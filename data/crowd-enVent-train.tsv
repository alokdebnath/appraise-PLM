It was connected to a free online database, so that users who downloaded the program could sign up if they were a first time user or login if they were a returning user.

We had to put our first dog down (a puppy who had very progressive cancer) a few months prior, and we were all ready for another dog. The woman who had trained our puppy knew a family that was looking to give their dog to a new home. She gave the seller our information, and they came to our house with the dog to see if we would be a good family for him. My parents didn't tell my brothers and I that we were going to possibly be getting a new dog. I walked downstairs and saw this big, fluffy, black doodle. I honestly don't know if I have ever been more excited. I was literally jumping up and down with joy. The family ended up giving us the dog, Vinny, free of charge, and he has been the best dog ever.

About 6 months later I was going for a walk and I realised that I had gotten through the worst of it and I had stayed clean and looking back at all the pain and suffering I had gone through to get clean, I felt such a sense of pride that I had been strong enough to do it on my own without any help from anyone.

This was also not the first time that she had made reference to my child and guns at school. I sat, i listened and i thought, its not really my childs style. I asked when this was said and i was told it was said over the xbox. I asked if this was by message or speaking on the mic and the teacher confirmed it was over the mic.

Being self-employed and in the arts meant there was next to nothing with regards to work. Eventually I began occupying my time better, but I was incredibly bored for about a week at one point. I knew I was bored because I usually enjoy playing console games when I have free time, but I sat there, scrolling through the list of games without any desire to particularly play any of them. I flirted with the idea of buying new games, but cheap ones, nearly pointless ones, just to fill my time for even a few moments. I’d usually succumb to smoking weed if I got that bored but even weed was boring it me at that point in time. Mentally checking out was all I wanted to do	I felt ... over lockdown quite a lot.

When I got home she told me to make a list of everything that makes me happy because I was going to then get rid of those items. She screamed at me that she hated me.

I was planning on just keeping it a secret and not associating myself with them anymore, but he decided to tell everyone we had sex. After that happened, I had people following me home every day when I walked home from school, I had garbage thrown at me, it was the most fearful I've ever been in my life because I never knew what exactly to expect.

I just went to find a random, much older person online, it wasn't special, it wasn't anything really, and I don't want to tell anyone about it (except this survey, congrats!). I'm ashamed that I didn't care about it, that I just wanted to experience it but didn't bother about it really, and I wish I hadn't done it. The shame is worse because I don't feel like I can tell anyone without making the shame worse. It's just not how it was meant to go.	I think about when I lost my virginity.
