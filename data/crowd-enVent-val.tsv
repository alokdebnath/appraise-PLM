Me and my dad were home and we had just returned from an outing. I was upstairs getting dressed and he was downstairs on the computer, and I could hear a popping sound. I thought that it was just the bathroom tap leaking but I still told my dad. He immediately thought it was an electrical issue so he turned off the house electricity from the mains. He stepped out of the house and all we could see was the roof on fire. I stupidly ran back in the house to get my phone and inhalers and he shouted me down, moved the  cars out of the driveway. The whole street was watching whilst the house was on fire, we'd called the fire engines and the police. My mum was called from work and when she turned onto the street she collapsed in shock, my dad was a mess and crying and running about. I was calm but inside I was scared. We were given a hotel from ther insurance company and it wasn't until the next day when we went to see the damage and all of the roof was gone, our bedrooms completely burnt down.

I was seeing a man for 4 years and we were very much in love. And then things changed. He went from being someone who I used to have fun with, laugh with, chat to all the time to someone who was completely focused on work, focused on making money, focused on the future and I no longer enjoyed being with him. However, because I had been with him for so long I stayed with him for another couple of months even though I no longer was happy in the relationship. During that time it seemed like every time we saw each other, I got nothing out of the encounter. All he would talk about was work (he was a lawyer) and football. Neither law or football hold any interest for me. It just seemed like everything that had initially brought us together had been removed and I was so bored and fed up with him. Unfortunately he didn't feel the same way and when I finished things he was absolutely devastated but for me, it was like starting a new life.	I felt ... in a relationship a number of years ago.
