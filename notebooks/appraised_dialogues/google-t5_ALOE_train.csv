We must accept that we have no power over people and realistically you will never get an explanation.
It happened to me to.
You can go down the rabbit hole of ""why"" but that will bring only pain.
Just block her everywhere and claim back your power. You were not born to be emotionally enslaved by somebody who doesn't give a s*** about you.
Block her everywhere, that's the first step.
After that, you have to give yourself closure and there are many techniques that can be used to do that.

The best way to come out of this is to accept that you can make mistakes, and we all do, and life is made this way, confusing and difficult to control, the fact that you've come this far, despite how exhausting it must be to carry this regret and guilt for years, shows how strong you are, how determined you are, you can still go far, you can still be happy, I believe in you.

I'm very shy and I find it difficult to express my feelings... so I took my time and at our 4th date I was finally able to tell her I liked her and I was interested in her, something that was more than obvious at that point. 

She did say anything back, she just kissed me. I thought it was a good sign but I was really wrong. For the next few days she was very and cute kind with me via text, sending kisses and stuff like that, something she never did before. This until the next weekend, we hanged out again and she told me she had to talk to me. She told me that I was a nice guy and that she really enjoyed hanging out with me but that her kiss changed nothing for her, that I was too much into her and she couldn't give me want I wanted, so it was better for me to stop seeing eachother and end things there. Obviously I was shocked, I couldn't imagine this complete overturn in just 5 days.

The strangest thing is that after telling me these things we walked a bit and then we kissed again, so I didn't really know what to think at that point... I thought maybe she was just having some soubts but I thought things would have worked out in the end. I was wrong again

The next day I texted her and she just became really cold, she was trying to avoid any kind of contact with me, she even found out excuses for a few times when I asked her to talk in person, till I finally was able to do so. She didn't change her mind, so things just ended. To be honest they never even started.

I'm so confused, where did I go wrong? If she didn't like me why didn't she just told me? Why after a month of dates she wasn't sure about anything and she had to kiss me to find out she didn't want anything from me? I'm really confused",h38nhv4,"I had the same thing, date and kisses for 3 days and then she wasn’t ready to be a couple.

The strangest thing is that after telling me these things we walked a bit and then we kissed again, so I didn't really know what to think at that point... I thought maybe she was just having some soubts but I thought things would have worked out in the end. I was wrong again

The next day I texted her and she just became really cold, she was trying to avoid any kind of contact with me, she even found out excuses for a few times when I asked her to talk in person, till I finally was able to do so. She didn't change her mind, so things just ended. To be honest they never even started.

I'm so confused, where did I go wrong? If she didn't like me why didn't she just told me? Why after a month of dates she wasn't sure about anything and she had to kiss me to find out she didn't want anything from me? I'm really confused

Work is stressful, most of my friends have either moved away or are starting their own families, and I'm fairly certain that the girl I've been spending time with is very toxic to my mental state. I'm having a hard time finding the point or joy in anything.

I'm constantly worrying where I stand with this girl, at times it feels like we're dating, but it also seems like she doesn't want a relationship. We kiss every time we're together, we've been very close to having sex, but I feel like every time we start getting very close she pulls away. This has been going on for about 5 months. I should probably let her know how I feel, if nothing else just so we're clear, but if she says that she isn't interested in dating then I have to walk away because I know it will wreak havoc on my mental health to be around her. And I don't want to because I really enjoy spending time with her. The part that is most upsetting is that we've been through this before, it was 8 years ago and it had the exact same outcome. I said how I felt (admittedly in a dumb/drunk way) and then she stopped spending time with me.

I'm going to talk to her about it this week after we go to a play together. But I'm honestly dreading it. I feel like I know the outcome and I'm going to fall harder into my depression because of it. I'm already waking up with massive anxiety every morning, so I guess it wont be too different then.

And I'm not going to be able to see my two best friends as much anymore after the next two weeks. One is moving to DC next week and the other is having his first child.

We had been together almost a year, and we hadn’t been fighting, were still seeing each other regularly, everything was going great. We were happy. Then about two days before he actually broke up with me he seemed to get really distant. He came to my house the other night and just asked if we could talk. He immediately broke down in tears and started saying things like “I really don’t want to do this. I hate doing this” but proceeded to tell me he thought it was best if we ended things. He said he needed to figure himself out, that he hated who he had become. The whole time he was hugging me, kissing my forehead, and crying. He said he was so happy with me but needed to learn to rely on himself. When he left my house he said that he would miss me. 
Now just two days later, he is posting on social media pictures of his friends, about how work is going for him, and honestly seems to be happy. I posted a picture of my best friend and I, and he liked the post almost immediately. But we have yet to actually be in contact since the breakup. 
I know it’s silly to overthink small things like a social media like, but I am just overall confused with how he seems to be handling things. I really would like to get back together as I felt that our relationship could have continued to grow. I feel as though he really will come back to me. Am I just in denial?

It’s such a hard reality to accept, but if he ended things, you have to leave him be — at least for right now. It may seem like your relationship could continue to grow, but there are clearly factors that led him to this decision. 

There is a possibility that a relationship between the two of you could work in the future, but it won’t be the same relationship as it was — and that’s a good thing. That relationship didn’t work, and trying to make the same relationship work again will just end in more pain. As you both heal, you will become different, better people, and maybe those people will end up together.

I’ve thought a lot about the idea of holding on to “false hope” too, and my therapist told me something really helpful. She told me, “You don’t have to call it false hope, you can just call it hope.” She told me that a few weeks ago, and it has really stuck with me. It’s ok to have a little bit of hope. You shouldn’t cling on to the idea, and you shouldn’t direct your own growth based on the idea that it will happen, but it’s ok right now that part of you wants it and hopes for it. Right now you have to focus on yourself, and let him focus on himself, and maybe the hope will play out.

We had been together almost a year, and we hadn’t been fighting, were still seeing each other regularly, everything was going great. We were happy. Then about two days before he actually broke up with me he seemed to get really distant. He came to my house the other night and just asked if we could talk. He immediately broke down in tears and started saying things like “I really don’t want to do this. I hate doing this” but proceeded to tell me he thought it was best if we ended things. He said he needed to figure himself out, that he hated who he had become. The whole time he was hugging me, kissing my forehead, and crying. He said he was so happy with me but needed to learn to rely on himself. When he left my house he said that he would miss me. 
Now just two days later, he is posting on social media pictures of his friends, about how work is going for him, and honestly seems to be happy. I posted a picture of my best friend and I, and he liked the post almost immediately. But we have yet to actually be in contact since the breakup. 
I know it’s silly to overthink small things like a social media like, but I am just overall confused with how he seems to be handling things. I really would like to get back together as I felt that our relationship could have continued to grow. I feel as though he really will come back to me. Am I just in denial? I hate the idea that I might be holding onto false hope. 
I’m taking this time to work on myself and focus on friends and my career, but I’m struggling to not contact him and ask how he is doing.

It’s such a hard reality to accept, but if he ended things, you have to leave him be — at least for right now. It may seem like your relationship could continue to grow, but there are clearly factors that led him to this decision. 

There is a possibility that a relationship between the two of you could work in the future, but it won’t be the same relationship as it was — and that’s a good thing. That relationship didn’t work, and trying to make the same relationship work again will just end in more pain. As you both heal, you will become different, better people, and maybe those people will end up together.

I’ve thought a lot about the idea of holding on to “false hope” too, and my therapist told me something really helpful. She told me, “You don’t have to call it false hope, you can just call it hope.” She told me that a few weeks ago, and it has really stuck with me. It’s ok to have a little bit of hope. You shouldn’t cling on to the idea, and you shouldn’t direct your own growth based on the idea that it will happen, but it’s ok right now that part of you wants it and hopes for it. Right now you have to focus on yourself, and let him focus on himself, and maybe the hope will play out. 

I would also suggest removing him from social media or perhaps taking a social media break all together.",2.3311262130737305,1.5818580985069275,2.759931206703186,2.5194034576416016,3.1850478649139404,1.9756928086280825,2.547499775886536,3.50760817527771,1.65452378988266,2.764824628829956,2.9411479234695435,1.599058210849762,3.829112529754639,3.5236740112304688,2.0744214057922363,1.0759214237332344,3.05063796043396,3.816529750823975,3.806525230407715,3.551643848419189,3.8341803550720215,3.8324804306030273

For a little backstory, 3 years ago it was discovered that I (43 now/m) had a very large tumor encapsulating my left kidney as well as the adrenal gland and lymph nodes around it. So I had them removed as well as a 3.18lb tumor. We have been sure that this will come back and we'll have to fight cancer again but I never thought it would be this soon.

Every 3 months I have my CT scans and over the last couple years there have been nodules slowly growing in my lungs. Today I had one of those CT scans and the radiologist report has been uploaded to my portal. There are many more nodules then there used to be, as well as one of them has now reached the 1cm size and the words metastatic disease was used in his diagnosis.

The last time it was so hard on those around me. My wife and daughter were strong and really tried not to show how much it affected them but it changed them. They went through so much but they were with me the whole way. And now it looks like I'm going to have to put them through this hell all over again. I don't know if I can put them through this again and I don't know if I can go through this again myself. My life was returning to normal, I have a job I like, it seemed this nightmare was in the distant past. I just feel like I have been kicked in the gut and had the rug pulled out from underneath of me.

My bf of almost a year and a half broke up with me yesterday. I am completely and utterly shocked. He suffers from depression and “doesn’t feel it anymore”. I guess he doesn’t feel love toward me anymore. The only friend I had before him was a guy who I dated for a very short period of time. I didn’t think it was appropriate to still be friends with him so we stopped talking. My bf was my best friend for so long. He is the only one I talk to and if I don’t have him I have no one. I thought I would always have him so I didn’t need anyone else. It is very difficult for me to make friends. He has many friends so I know he has people to reach out to and go through this with.

To be honest it's easy to make this about yourself but remember that he hasn't broken up with you to isolate you, he has broken up with you because he doesn't feel like being in a relationship with you is right for him anymore.

You can try to speak to him and get some clarity but realistically I think you need to get a small support network together, even if it's here on Reddit, to help you through the rocky beginning.

It seems to come in waves and when you are trying to stay strong for the others around you it can delay that even more over time. My sister passed away from cancer a year ago, she had battled it for 7.5 years while trying to raise her children, who experienced their dad dying from cancer as well three years prior to her death. What a journey!

What I learned from it is this.... take all the time and ways in which you express your grief you need. No two people will grieve in the same way. If any of the stages of grief come up, give them space, time and it's due attention for the moment. However, don't get stuck. I used to find comfort in journaling my thoughts, conversations I would have liked to have with my sister and my hurts, pains and anything else. Maybe you might find some help in that too?

I lost my father to cancer 7 months ago and i feel like shit constantly i go some dark places sometimes but im 25 now and i have little brother and mom looking up to me i try to stay  strong and reliable for them but i know im not that strong i have some mental breakdowns but i go away from my family and i live them alone its not good for me i know it but its what i had to do for now for sake of my mom and little brother sorry for typos and bad english its not my strong suit..

observer:

Grief is so personal my friend. It seems to come in waves and when you are trying to stay strong for the others around you it can delay that even more over time. My sister passed away from cancer a year ago, she had battled it for 7.5 years while trying to raise her children, who experienced their dad dying from cancer as well three years prior to her death. What a journey!

What I learned from it is this.... take all the time and ways in which you express your grief you need. No two people will grieve in the same way. If any of the stages of grief come up, give them space, time and it's due attention for the moment. However, don't get stuck. I used to find comfort in journaling my thoughts, conversations I would have liked to have with my sister and my hurts, pains and anything else. Maybe you might find some help in that too? It's like having a place to ""park"" it without having to talk to someone else if you don't want to.

Over the weekend, I found out that my abusive ex, who I have not had contact with since the relationship ended back in 2019 passed away a few months ago. I had no idea until I randomly got the urge to search him and see what he was up to that he had passed away.
I’m dealing with a mix of emotions right now and I’m curious if anyone who has gone through a similar situation could relate or give me advice. On one hand, I’m relieved. It is nice to know that I will never have to fear randomly bumping into him when I am out. It is comforting to know he can never, ever abuse anyone else again. But I am also sad. He was an addict, and it was ultimately his addiction that took his life. I wish he got the help he needed and although he did absolutely terrible things to me, I would never wish death upon anyone. He has also been gone for awhile now, but like I said I didn’t have contact with him so I didn’t find out until I took the means of searching him up myself. I feel like because he’s been gone for awhile, I shouldn’t be feeling really anything.

I would encourage you to consider attending the viewing/service/event (if this family has one) and watch for something: when the family very first arrives, they are going to be very apprehensive about the situation as their last memory of their loved one is in a very tramatic moment.

Basically in these situations he pointed out how these events are tramatic and terrible. There is no good in that moment. We cannot change that.

But we are in a position where we can make the worst time in someone's life a little less difficult.

I would encourage you to consider attending the viewing/service/event (if this family has one) and watch for something: when the family very first arrives, they are going to be very apprehensive about the situation as their last memory of their loved one is in a very tramatic moment. Watch how they are heartbroken when they see their loved one in the casket. And watch how they are comforted (usually) by seeing their loved one was cared for and the moment was made so the family can have some peaceful moments with their loved one once again. 

Knowing that we are able give them a little extra time with their loved one can give you the strength to do the nitty gritty to ensure that can be done for them.

Those cases will still continue to suck, but having a grieving mother/spouse/sibling look at you, hold your hand and say ""thank you for helping me see my son/wife/loved one/etc. again"" is really powerful",2.502617359161377,1.810826361179352,2.6316200494766235,2.4853490591049194,2.4097646474838257,1.9211767315864563,1.9313255548477173,3.459975481033325,2.325628161430359,2.154806137084961,3.0739905834198,1.9868522882461548,3.669637441635132,3.619540929794312,2.071148157119751,1.020615890622139,3.099226474761963,3.047281265258789,3.6384024620056152,3.149690866470337,4.034621238708496,3.1222314834594727

I hope to see you move on and be happy!",2.80018150806427,1.9286972880363464,3.300662040710449,2.404255509376526,3.0786449909210205,2.0160670280456543,2.2425817251205444,3.375600814819336,2.1812872886657715,2.618960380554199,3.1381335258483887,2.430854082107544,3.59065842628479,3.4566545486450195,2.414140820503235,1.805866301059723,2.9699931144714355,3.449375629425049,3.861649990081787,3.116761922836304,3.872427225112915,3.961735725402832

Get angry. Stop blaming yourself for not doing this sooner. Forgive yourself and direct your anger at the appropriate target - your abuser. Hold onto that anger until it's over. Hold onto it until he's been tried, convicted, and sentenced. Let the anger fuel you and give your strength. 


Then, when it's all over, let go of the anger. Find a DV support group. Take victims' classes. Rebuild yourself and rebuild your life.

I'm gobsmacked by their response. I'm in shock they believe me. I'm relieved they are going to investigate. I will do everything in my power to ensure he is held accountable. 

But to have it all fit in 2 hours.
To know that I could have spent 2 hours talking about it to save myself years of living it has broken me.

I can feel again and I don't want to.

I left 6 weeks ago. For 3 years I hid what was happening. I didn't talk about it. I suffered, god I suffered so much.

I have cried for a minute or so a couple of times since I left. I've been detached. Life has felt like a dream. I sleep 2 hours a night maximum. I haven't felt what happened. 

But now I can. And it hurts so much and I have no one, I have no one I can talk to that will hold me and tell me I'll be okay. I have no one that I can cry with. My mum knew I had this today but she didn't even text to ask how it went or what the outcome was. No one cares. No one loves me. I have no one that I can call so I don't go through this alone. I need to switch it off because I cannot do this, I can't keep going if I have to feel.

I care. I care and I am so proud of you. 


Get angry. Stop blaming yourself for not doing this sooner. Forgive yourself and direct your anger at the appropriate target - your abuser. Hold onto that anger until it's over. Hold onto it until he's been tried, convicted, and sentenced. Let the anger fuel you and give your strength. 


Then, when it's all over, let go of the anger. Find a DV support group. Take victims' classes. Rebuild yourself and rebuild your life.

I know what to do. But there’s something about moving on that feels very wrong. I don’t even want to leave this state. It feels as if I’m living a dream because I believe she will come back. Even if she found someone else, I’d probably still be here because I want to be. 

I’ve accepted she’s gone. I’ve accepted she isn’t coming back. I’ve accepted she will find someone else. I’ve accepted she’ll love that person. I’ve accepted that she’ll get married and she’ll be happier with that person. I want her to be happy. I really do. I wish she was happy with me and I wish she would try again. But if she didn’t I know it would be because she wouldn’t be happy with me. Her happiness is the most important thing in the world to me. 

I know it’ll kill me to see it all. It’s okay. I just want her to heal and move on. I love her unconditionally and if she’s happy than that will give me some contentment.

We did this to protect ourselves from pain that is MUCH deeper and stronger than this. 

We second guess ourselves but our brains are smart. Love is an incredibly strong and addictive drug. I think it’s great though, that once we start to second guess or encounter a severe disconnect in a relationship, our brains say “fuck this”. 

We second guess our brain giving us the exact feedback we needed. Just because that feedback is not the comfort we wanted!

It’s always going to be a battle between the true correct decision, and what feels good in the moment.

Don’t succumb to the momentary comfort if your brain has already said “fuck this” and made you rationalize being single. Be strong. I’m right here with you, and it sucks. It’s worth it though.

I half wished he'd turn back or get out of the car so we could talk. All I wanted to do was hug him and wish him well. Now I feel like I'm drowning again.

I know our split was for the best but I still love him miss him in a way that's twisting and tearing. I feel like someone has ripped a chunk out of me.

Like my last post I'll probably post an edit informing ye that I'm fine again but right now it's so painful I feel like I'm dying.",2.6668487787246704,1.8744307160377505,3.3727920055389404,2.519503593444824,3.1867401599884038,2.1659867763519287,2.5439122915267944,3.251786708831787,1.7795295715332031,2.7306469678878784,3.0675272941589355,2.3810153007507324,3.824584007263184,3.572896718978882,2.204656958580017,2.3575034141540527,3.272311925888061,3.3772099018096924,3.932469367980957,4.05902886390686,145,0,"I’m sure that was super hard!

I really don’t like that I have to put them on a higher pedestal to make them feel better, but I get it; some people need the coddling.

Now to the issue: every time my husband deals with them we get into an argument. No matter what.

Those exact words…and this always causes an issue with my husband because that makes them get into arguments. And then because he’s mad at them being frustrated with me he will start an argument with me about how I need to put in extra work with his family to make everything peaceful.

We go through this enough and it’s infuriating. And it causes a rift each time and if I say one wrong thing he doesn’t take it well. For example, I said I would tolerate his family and respect them and he got upset because he said, “you don’t tolerate family because they’re family,” and he says this every time.

I feel that if I were in one of my friends positions I'd be gladly doing all the things and even asking if they want me to.

 I feel pretty betrayed. I can't ask them to know what I'm going through, but I find myself getting worked up until making angry remarks which I later regret. This is the time that I need actual grace and support and it's elusive.

I had to lay my 15 yo labpit mix to rest just over a week ago. I knew it was coming. The timing was right, but the end felt very unorganized and haphazard, as much as I wanted to honor her with a beautiful ending.

 I feel so immensely alone. (I'm grateful to have found this group, though) I barely had support for the event and I've been coping with distractions and other things since. It's hard to feed myself,  to be motivated to do anything, to be willing to give myself space to grieve... 


I've been angry at the lack of support from those ""closest"" to me and it's caused me to question the relationships themselves. Don't they know this is the hardest thing that has ever happened to me and I need extra support and compassion, physical and emotional, than ever before? I just want to leave, give up, start over. I feel like not risking love or dependence/attachment on or to another,  again. Am i unworthy of asking for extra help and support? I feel that if I were in one of my friends positions I'd be gladly doing all the things and even asking if they want me to.

 I feel pretty betrayed. I can't ask them to know what I'm going through, but I find myself getting worked up until making angry remarks which I later regret. This is the time that I need actual grace and support and it's elusive.

I know I should block her , but after spending 3 years with her I just don't have it in me to let it go..",2.7606712579727173,2.405345916748047,3.4688949584960938,2.2383830547332764,2.872267484664917,2.547335624694824,1.7989789843559263,3.829111337661743,1.9581303596496584,2.802371859550476,3.14969253540039,2.395238995552063,3.5847418308258057,4.498291492462158,2.404211163520813,2.25283420085907,3.172360420227051,3.1446871757507324,3.599374294281006,3.7453978061676025,191,0,"I think you did the right thing to let her know you were okay. You can't really know what she is thinking and her reaching out and showing concern at all isn't a bad thing necessarily.

Just don't enter into a lesser relationship with her unless you're content with it. Friendship for instance is possible with an ex but only if your feelings are that you don't want them romantically anymore. And as you seem to still want that relationship, it's best to keep that boundary and let her open that conversation if she wants to.

Keep healing yourself and move forward, and I guess you'll see if she ever reaches out again. You don't need to block her.

Do it in tinker bells honor at the very least.,3.179013252258301,2.7137314081192017,2.860376477241516,2.157896876335144,2.593657612800598,1.9718146920204165,2.509860754013061,3.581536293029785,3.1955854892730717,3.2093300819396973,3.278620481491089,2.9740068912506104,2.995047450065613,3.9371743202209473,2.387414813041687,1.571474552154541,2.927184224128723,2.8031657934188843,3.5899791717529297,2.990622639656067,2.9268383979797363,3.8450422286987305

You deserve to be in a relationship with someone who treats you with respect and kindness, and who returns the feelings you have. 

I think it’s good to separate the two issues- the relationship you’re in from any other possibilities. Do you want to be in a long term romantic relationship with someone who, after almost a year, doesn’t love you? If you choose to end this relationship, you’re not throwing anything away. You’re recognizing that a relationship has run its course and you’re not prepared or willing to spend more time, energy, and effort in the situation. That’s not throwing things away. That’s being true to what you want and need in your life. 

So make a decision about the relationship you’re currently in based on its own merits.

There are so many people in the world. I won’t say there’s better. But I will say there’s different. There’s a lot of different out there. And the fact that you’re here right now- and neither option stands out? That sort of tells me that the relationship you’re in isn’t really doing what you need.","target:

Since then it has been back and forth to the hospital almost every week. She is not compliant with meds (she has gastritis and they hurt her stomach). So most of these hospital trips have resulted from her not taking her meds properly. 

She's a very emotional person with an anxiety disorder and cries most of the day when she isn't feeling well. This is very hard on me. I have Aspberger's and am not good at comforting people.

So yesterday she got up and fixed her breakfast then took her blood pressure and it was 180/90. She panicked and doubled up on her beta blocker. She had also been only taking half the prescribed dose of her blood thinner. This resulted in an episode of feeling light headed and her anxiety was out of control. We ended up calling 911 and she was brought to the hospital and released in a few hours. 

I know this is going to sound petty, but she ruined my day. She interrupted all three of my meals so I had to wolf them down. She called from the hospital and insisted that I come get her right away. I had a Fresh order coming and had just sat down to lunch. Then I had to do a bunch of things for her. I didn't rest all day. I had a long list of house chores and I did finish them around 8 p.m. and went to bed sore and exhausted. This was my one day off from work for the whole month. 

On top of struggling with anxiety myself, I am going through menopause, dealing with chronic pain, and have been battling a case of widespread hives for which I can't find a cause. Possibly stress. I barely slept all night because I itched all over.

I know this is going to sound petty, but she ruined my day. She interrupted all three of my meals so I had to wolf them down. She called from the hospital and insisted that I come get her right away. I had a Fresh order coming and had just sat down to lunch. Then I had to do a bunch of things for her. I didn't rest all day. I had a long list of house chores and I did finish them around 8 p.m. and went to bed sore and exhausted. This was my one day off from work for the whole month. 

On top of struggling with anxiety myself, I am going through menopause, dealing with chronic pain, and have been battling a case of widespread hives for which I can't find a cause. Possibly stress. I barely slept all night because I itched all over. 

None of my family can be bothered to come help. I know this is all par for the course and many of you have it worse.

It’s been ten years since my dad killed hisself and murdered my 3 year old brother. I stopped speaking for the first 6 months. I honestly have no recollection of that time other than a few flashes.

It was the first death I had experienced ever and it left me numb. We don’t live in the Philippines and the night she died we didn’t know, but I had this feeling that her soul was visiting me for the last time because I had the sudden urge to hold her bracelet she gifted me last Christmas and just pray. I knew she was present in my room the whole night. The next morning I woke up to my parents running around the house on the phone with family crying and at that point I just knew. That day went by so painfully slow, it was the first time I ever so my dad cry and it hurt my heart.

I held onto a lot of regret and anger ever since because I felt like I could’ve spent so many more moments with her growing up, my biggest fear is that she died feeling like her only grandkids didn’t care for her because I’ve only seen her like five times in my life, everything else was on video call. I just miss her so much and I wish I could just hug her and brush her hair like she let me do. I questioned my religion after she died, I kept praying because I didn’t want her to be in purgatory forever, if ever is was an afterlife (which I hope there is), I’d want her to be with her husband and her son.

I lost my lola (tagalog for grandma) my dad’s mother about last summer. It was the first death I had experienced ever and it left me numb. We don’t live in the Philippines and the night she died we didn’t know, but I had this feeling that her soul was visiting me for the last time because I had the sudden urge to hold her bracelet she gifted me last Christmas and just pray. I knew she was present in my room the whole night. The next morning I woke up to my parents running around the house on the phone with family crying and at that point I just knew. That day went by so painfully slow, it was the first time I ever so my dad cry and it hurt my heart. I felt so numb like I couldn’t believe that this was happening and I didn’t know if this was real, I really thought I was dreaming. I didn’t know what to say or do to comfort my dad. I held onto a lot of regret and anger ever since because I felt like I could’ve spent so many more moments with her growing up, my biggest fear is that she died feeling like her only grandkids didn’t care for her because I’ve only seen her like five times in my life, everything else was on video call. I just miss her so much and I wish I could just hug her and brush her hair like she let me do. I questioned my religion after she died, I kept praying because I didn’t want her to be in purgatory forever, if ever is was an afterlife (which I hope there is), I’d want her to be with her husband and her son. I feel like her death was very traumatizing to me, it’s almost summer and I’m so scared that I’ll fall into a depression nearing her death anniversary but I’m too scared to talk about it to my parents or to any experts.

I recently broke up with a really really great guy. Sweet, kind, thoughtful, handsome, well educated...literally nothing “wrong” with him. It broke my heart to hurt him but...he deserves someone who can love him back like he deserves. For an inexplicable reason it just wasn’t there for me.

Sounds like your SO has some growing up to do. They need to accept they fucked up.

You have A LOT to offer. What about your love and companionship?? Your intelligence and wit? You have a lot going for you, no need to devalue yourself.

Obviously your SO knows this that is why they are back. See this as a chance FOR THEM to prove to you that they won't bail again. You are good enough, definitely. Your SO wasn't so they left and hurt you badly. Blamed you. Don't take those insults as truth.

I tell her we can’t be friends and she just nodded and smiled, she felt the same.

hello all, this is my first post on here. so sorry for any grammar or formatting issues. 

so basically, last month, my brother (15m) killed himself. he showed no warning signs, gave no indications, nothing at all. he had no prior history of any mental health issues, no behavioral issues, nothing at all. no one understands it. we also don’t know why, as he didn’t leave a note and there’s no information at all on his phone. it’s been crazy hectic for me and my family, and every day has been a struggle. he’s the first one to pass in my family since my great grandfather in 2001, so it’s taking a massive toll on me and my family. i just don’t know what to do with myself, and i don’t know how to move on, or carry on with “life as usual”. i miss him so much, it hurts sometimes. any advice with how to cope at all would be good. thank you all",h2isdio,"I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. 

Grief sucks. It’s like something you couldn’t imagine until you’ve lived with it. You don’t need to return to normal life right now.

173,173,2626,ttcafterloss,t3_o2pii7,o2pii7," Good morning everyone.

I'm having a really hard time today and I recognize some of it could be me being hormonal thanks to the progesterone I'm on. I've been crying off and on for two days. This progesterone is making me feel like I'm pregnant but I'm getting nothing but BFNs so I'm pretty sure I'm not since my period is almost due. It's making me feel like I did when I was pregnant and reminding me that I lost it and that I would be almost 4 months pregnant right now if I hadn't. I just want to curl up in a ball and give up. I'm so tired. I haven't slept well in a couple of days and I've been spending time with my brother and his family (including my 3 year old nephew). Every time I go home from visiting with them I cry because I'm afraid I'll never have that. I'll never have the fun bath times and the reading a book to my baby before bed. I'm afraid I'll never get to watch my own child grow up.

I don't want to stop visiting with them because they don't live locally and I don't know when I'll see them again.

I'm just having a really hard time right now and need some encouragement. Thanks all.",h27tkbo,"All of these things are so hard individually: loss, trying again after loss, side effects from progesterone, and being around small children. But you’re having to tackle them all together at the same time and it’s a lot, of course you’re feeling upset. 

The most helpful / unhelpful advice I have is that it gets better with time. In the meantime, while it still sucks, a few things that might make things suck less: take your tests with your partner so you’re not going through the process alone; pick a day to test where the outcome is definitive so you’re not putting yourself in limbo by testing too early; have something else to do / look forward to on test day; give yourself a time limit for being around small children before you give yourself a break. 

I’m sorry all of this is happening. Big hugs to you. ❤️","target:

In the meantime, while it still sucks, a few things that might make things suck less: take your tests with your partner so you’re not going through the process alone; pick a day to test where the outcome is definitive so you’re not putting yourself in limbo by testing too early; have something else to do / look forward to on test day; give yourself a time limit for being around small children before you give yourself a break.

I'm having a really hard time today and I recognize some of it could be me being hormonal thanks to the progesterone I'm on. I've been crying off and on for two days. This progesterone is making me feel like I'm pregnant but I'm getting nothing but BFNs so I'm pretty sure I'm not since my period is almost due. It's making me feel like I did when I was pregnant and reminding me that I lost it and that I would be almost 4 months pregnant right now if I hadn't. I just want to curl up in a ball and give up. I'm so tired. I haven't slept well in a couple of days and I've been spending time with my brother and his family (including my 3 year old nephew). Every time I go home from visiting with them I cry because I'm afraid I'll never have that. I'll never have the fun bath times and the reading a book to my baby before bed. I'm afraid I'll never get to watch my own child grow up.

I don't want to stop visiting with them because they don't live locally and I don't know when I'll see them again.

I'm just having a really hard time right now and need some encouragement.

When you break up because your partner cheated at the start it feels horrible, but then after some point you realise they didn't love you, or didn't love you *enough*.

But when you break up for unavoidable reasons such as distance, when you both break up while loving each other to the fullest, that's when it hurts the most in the long run.

Because you realise you lost someone that truly loved you.

It's not that I don't love my bio mom. But I'll never be able to reconcile what might have happened with her ex girlfriend. I played therapist to my mom growing up. I don't know what to look for in a mother figure.

How her sister tried to steal me and my sister from her. I remember how her sister tried to poison us against her by telling us her ex-girlfriend molested us and turned a blind eye. I don't remember being molested by an adult as a child. I don't remember being a child.

Mom. I care about this person who hurt me and I don't know if I can blame her for hurting me. But I hurt and I need someone to care about me in the same way I care about her. And I don't know how to ask for that.

193,193,329,heartbreak,t3_oayo14,oayo14,"1. 3 months ago, I've met a new girl. It was just a random girl for me at the beginning. But since we've been residing so close to each other (I could see her from my window and every time she left her home) we hang out together and we keep hanging out more and more. I felt something then and confessed my feelings to her. She said that she already knew it but she is scared of a relationship at that point so she said let the time decides our fate. However, she took bigger steps and we had a relationship that full of gaslighting and full of her imbalances.

She was adamant to not work on it since the start but as I knew that she did this thing that you've to do it again and again(beg) and I was weak so I did that for 1 month in intervals begging to her and making her understand that give me a chance atleast.

But now she's in this attitude bitch mode and as she and my sister are friends  she tells her sometimes that ""owh {I} asked and she said it's not happening in this life"" basically trying to show that she's a high value person and all.

                      1. Does that make me a invaluable person to chase the person I love?

201,201,393,GriefSupport,t3_oa0in1,oa0in1,"I feel guilty

I feel so guilty. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, my precious grandmother was murdered. She was shot and killed by a stranger. She was perfectly healthy. 

Rewind to the day before her death, I was discussing with a coworker grief and feelings of loss. I explained to her how I had lost a grandparent before (my grandpa on dads side) but it didn’t really effect me. I wasn’t close with him.  I said it was sad, but I had never truly experienced loss of grief of missing a loved one. 
I explained to her that when my grandmother died, it would be my first time to truly experience loss. And that it would devastate me. 

The next day, less than 24 hours later, my grandmother was shot and killed. 

To say I’m devastated is an understatement. She was a huge part of my life. She was very special in my heart. 

And I feel like her death was a jinx on my part. I feel like I jinxed myself having that conversation with my co worker the day prior.

I feel guilty

I feel so guilty. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, my precious grandmother was murdered. She was shot and killed by a stranger. She was perfectly healthy. 

Rewind to the day before her death, I was discussing with a coworker grief and feelings of loss. I explained to her how I had lost a grandparent before (my grandpa on dads side) but it didn’t really effect me. I wasn’t close with him.  I said it was sad, but I had never truly experienced loss of grief of missing a loved one. 
I explained to her that when my grandmother died, it would be my first time to truly experience loss. And that it would devastate me. 

The next day, less than 24 hours later, my grandmother was shot and killed. 

To say I’m devastated is an understatement. She was a huge part of my life. She was very special in my heart. 

And I feel like her death was a jinx on my part. I feel like I jinxed myself having that conversation with my co worker the day prior.

I found out a few weeks ago that he's got this lump on his neck that's been there for around 18 months and he's done NOTHING about it.

The lump on his neck is apparently a lymph node - 5cm by 5cm so, it's now quite visible. He's been to an ENT and they found nothing of interest. He has NO symptoms, no weight loss, no night sweats - nothing except for the lump on his neck.  


They did the biopsy on his neck and apparently it's cancer but they don't know where it is or what kind.

The CT and MRI have also shown nothing. There's a small lump on one of the adrenal glands, but they're not really sure if that's it as as above... no symptoms whatsoever.

He had some prostate issues a few years ago but his levels are all fine so I have no idea what to think.  


The doctor yesterday apparently seemed surprised by all of the above.

I found out last night that my Dad (57) has been diagnosed with cancer.

I found out a few weeks ago that he's got this lump on his neck that's been there for around 18 months and he's done NOTHING about it. Part of me is really angry/disappointed - especially given my Mum knew and didn't make him go to the doctor. I wish she'd told me and I would have got him to go... 18 f\*\*\*\*\*\* months. 

The lump on his neck is apparently a lymph node - 5cm by 5cm so, it's now quite visible. He's been to an ENT and they found nothing of interest. He has NO symptoms, no weight loss, no night sweats - nothing except for the lump on his neck.  


They did the biopsy on his neck and apparently it's cancer but they don't know where it is or what kind.

The CT and MRI have also shown nothing. There's a small lump on one of the adrenal glands, but they're not really sure if that's it as as above... no symptoms whatsoever.

He had some prostate issues a few years ago but his levels are all fine so I have no idea what to think.  


The doctor yesterday apparently seemed surprised by all of the above.

Has anyone else just had a lump but no symptoms? Is this a good sign or...

I took care of my dad for about 8 months. He's bedbound with severe dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. I had no help during this time, despite begging my mom multiple times to put him in a nursing home. Caregiving destroyed my mental health and caused me to have a mental breakdown. I ended up finally standing up for myself and setting a boundary with my mother: that I was done being a caregiver. After this, my mom stepped back in to take care of him.

It's been a few months and repairing my mental health is still a daily struggle. I was able to get him set up with hospice, so now Mom has a bit of help. However, she still refuses to put him in a nursing home.

Today I was asked to watch my dad for a few days, because my sister is driving up North for a funeral and needs someone to watch her 6 kids (my mom). My mom guilted me into caring for my dad again during this time because ""family just does that for each other"" (even though my sister literally never goes out of her way to help family, but that's another story). The other option I was given is to let my mom continue caring for Dad while *I* go stay at my sister's house for a few days to watch her kids (without any compensation, of course), which also sounds miserable. 

I feel like being a caregiver was actually traumatic for me, because the thought of having to do it again for just a few days has been giving me panic attacks. It's also going against the boundary I set. But I still feel like an asshole if I refuse. What would y'all do in this situation?",h27fy14,"It is okay to put yourself first.

I thought I had it figured out. She was stunning and wonderful but then all of the sudden, nothing. Am I being too sensitive? I am confused, sad, and hurt. I'm not eating and I have trouble sleeping.

It's not what you expect from someone you love and it can feel like the legs have been cut out from under you. It's enough to make anyone feel emotionally desperate and is very hard to deal with.

What I want you to do is find yourself something you want to eat. A pie or a pizza, a cake, ice cream- anything at all you think you can stomach. You don't want to get out of the habit of eating and I want you to make sure you take care of your body, even though you're struggling mentally right now (totally understandable given the circumstances). Then, I want you to take the pressure off yourself. Feel your feelings, they are real and they are yours- give yourself time. It's OK to cry. But know that you will move past this.

You've are a strong person who has overcome challenges and sadness before. Your life is not going to take the path you thought it would, and it's OK to feel sad about that. It's hard. But believe me when I say that one day you will be able to look back on this as a dark time that you found your way through, that was necessary to get to where you needed to be- a path that needed to be walked. Life is about the journey rather than the destination and you have the tools you need to make it very worthwhile. 

Good luck to you. I know your mother would be proud.","target:

She is scheduled for in home euthanasia this Monday. I am worried I am torturing her by waiting until then to avoid her dying at the vet (she doesn’t like the vet). She has barely eaten in the last five days. Stopped eating pretty much in the last two.

Yesterday June 17th I found out I miscarried my baby. I went in for a second ultrasound at 9 weeks (first u /s was 7 weeks 1 day, with visible heartbeat) and there was no heartbeat this time. I knew it too, because I know what that flicker looks like and I know how it looks when there is no flickering heart on the ultrasound screen. She didn't tell me the BPM, had me stay changed, and came back with the doctor a few minutes later to have him watch too, to really make sure it wasn't there. Obviously it was not.

I had tried so hard to get that ultrasound for any day other than yesterday, any day other than June 17th. Because yesterday was the 12th birthday of my full term stillborn son (with ex husband). I tried to convince myself it was a good sign to have my follow up ultrasound on his birthday, praying there was no way I could lose two babies on the same day. Obviously it did not work out that way.

Now I am double heartbroken and I seem to be collecting angels.

But I don't want angels, I want a baby.

I am so sad. So so so sad.

I had been on the fence for years with my husband about wanting a baby (he has always wanted another -- has a 17 year old son from his first marriage). It took getting the positive pregnancy test to make me realize how badly I want a baby. How badly I want to start a family of our own with my husband.

I feel broken and lost. Life isn't fair. I'm so mad, I'm so sad. I needed somewhere to say all of this. I need support.

Yesterday June 17th I found out I miscarried my baby. I went in for a second ultrasound at 9 weeks (first u /s was 7 weeks 1 day, with visible heartbeat) and there was no heartbeat this time. I knew it too, because I know what that flicker looks like and I know how it looks when there is no flickering heart on the ultrasound screen. She didn't tell me the BPM, had me stay changed, and came back with the doctor a few minutes later to have him watch too, to really make sure it wasn't there. Obviously it was not.

I had tried so hard to get that ultrasound for any day other than yesterday, any day other than June 17th. Because yesterday was the 12th birthday of my full term stillborn son (with ex husband). I tried to convince myself it was a good sign to have my follow up ultrasound on his birthday, praying there was no way I could lose two babies on the same day. Obviously it did not work out that way.

Now I am double heartbroken and I seem to be collecting angels.

But I don't want angels, I want a baby.

I am so sad. So so so sad.

I had been on the fence for years with my husband about wanting a baby (he has always wanted another -- has a 17 year old son from his first marriage). It took getting the positive pregnancy test to make me realize how badly I want a baby. How badly I want to start a family of our own with my husband.

I feel broken and lost. Life isn't fair. I'm so mad, I'm so sad. I needed somewhere to say all of this. I need support. I've told so many people, and now I have to give out bad news again.",2.92439353466034,2.493124961853028,3.125087022781372,2.1028839349746704,2.8075121641159058,2.227402448654175,2.8481298685073853,2.912883162498474,2.034349799156189,2.6364108324050903,3.498670816421509,2.3495097160339355,3.4791014194488525,2.946517586708069,2.5596050024032597,2.109891176223755,2.627997040748596,3.34273624420166,3.9286718368530273,3.423504114151001,563,0,"Gawd 😣🫂💙I am so sorry for your losses.

Also nobody needs ^ that type of person in their life. I am lost in purgatory. I’m petrified. I can’t do simple things. I wish I was just gone. So many deaths for people who didn’t deserve, for people with so much to give. I should give my all for everyone from whom that opportunity was taken away, but right now I rather wish to trade my life with someone. Or that my life never came to pass in the first place. But I cannot fantasize, that is a waste of time. But I cannot even move myself to do anything but. I am a waste. I hope I can just be gone soon really at this point.

Yes, I agree that this is the worst when you know what's good for you, but that you just lack the will to do so.

Yes, we broke up, no she didn't cheat on me, but for the first time in a while I think it's for the better. I have some mental health issues, I'm running from myself, and it's time to face myself. I'm fearing. It's going to be hard. And I can feel that I wanna close up for everyone, just hide from the world, but the same time I want to be a better person, I want to have peace in my mind. I know I won't loose either of them. My now ex girlfriend and I looking after each other for 5 years and only been in a relationship for the last 9 months. Probably we just needed someone to love, I don't know. For me it seems like that even I'm broken, sad and disappointed that even after this surrealistic situation I don't want to lose either of them. Am I the stupid? I just want to find peace and love.

We called up this morning to schedule a time to put him down and we were supposed to go in at 4pm. But at 11am he went into heart failure and started seizing. We rushed him to the vet but he didn’t make it.

I loved that dog so damn much and I can’t believe he’s gone. What’s eating at me is that if we had brought him in sooner, we maybe could’ve spared his suffering and let him go peacefully. I don’t wish this feeling on anyone",2.5482301712036133,2.3401063680648804,3.445708036422729,2.14090359210968,3.2587904930114746,2.445754289627075,2.194291353225708,3.478508949279785,2.09326434135437,2.503643751144409,2.9941415786743164,1.9967361688613887,3.8401010036468506,3.3947341442108154,2.1629912853240967,2.3248403072357178,3.315654754638672,3.4901461601257324,3.8041703701019287,3.733067274093628,591,0,"I'm so sorry for your loss.

I know all too well how it is to watch your beloved pet decline and to wrestle with the decision of is it too soon, are we doing the right thing, should we have done something sooner.  


I think Toby knew he was loved when he passed. The fact that you were able to give him another eight months of love, affection, and time with the people he adores, even with as hard a condition as congestive heart failure can be, is a testament to the fact that you were doing what was best for him.

But I’m 27, and in theory I have a lot of my life still ahead of me. I’ve always wanted a family, children, that domestic bliss, and I was so looking forward to that with my partner who died. So much that it hurts to think about and I’ll always grieve it.

I would give anything to have that future back with my partner. And I’m not ready to date, not nearly ready. It’s too soon, it still hurts way too much. But … I still sometimes hope that my dream can come true. That I can find somebody else to share that life with who will make me happy.

It is totally normal for it all to come swooping back, and it will settle back to where you were afterwards, I promise.

I lost my dad 6 years ago, and for me, the week before the date is almost always worse than the day itself (idk, grieving/traumatised brains are weird). I don't think I've ever done any little ceremony/remembrance type stuff other than thinking of him on a significant day (other than drinking port on Christmas eve, because he used to give us it when we were little to get us to go to sleep lol, but I did that before too). 

My sibling is different, they still take the anniversary off every year, no plans made, because not having to be a functional human on that day is what they need. I think they sometimes light a candle. 

The first anniversary sucks for everyone, basically, but differently, so it's OK to deal with it however feels best for you.

I lost my dad around 3 months ago and then lost mum a couple of days ago. They both had poor health (dad had cancer and mum had mobility issues and struggled with alcohol) so sometimes even simple things seemed like a struggle.

They always strived to be good people and I felt like they got dealt a shitty hand. I did my best to make things easier but I just despair at the fact that things were so hard for them, even in the end. 

It all feels so overwhelming. I'm extremely lucky as I have a wonderful support system but it all feels so daunting. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the day to day in the beginning? Everything feels like such a fog right now

I’m so sorry honey. Don’t feel guilty. I read somewhere that our lives timelines are predestined. If you hadn’t found the cat, it was still her time to go. 

Don’t let yourself take on the low vibrational feelings of guilt or regret. 

If you can, try to honor her in some way. Make a donation to an animal shelter or volunteer at one, they always need extra hands! 

May her little cat spirit send you signs she’s peacefully transitioned on the other side.

When I could sleep, I’d wake up in a cold sweat an hour or so later. I took a week off work because I couldn’t function; I was an absolute mess! I cried at some point every day for at least two months, but the pain became less and less unbearable with time. I started noticing tangible progress. My ex wasn’t the first thing I thought of when I woke up. They were maybe the second or third thought, but it was something. I’d go entire days without crying. I wanted some sort of quick fix but time is what helped. Try to get up and do things you enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. Go for a walk, throw yourself into a hobby, get a new hobby, surround yourself with positive people, anything. I also found journaling to be incredibly therapeutic. Early on, I made a list of things that just weren’t working in the relationship and when I felt overwhelmed with sadness or anger, I’d pull it out and read it. Keeping busy is great for distraction, but also allow yourself time to just feel and process things. You will get through this, I promise.","target:

When I could sleep, I’d wake up in a cold sweat an hour or so later. I took a week off work because I couldn’t function; I was an absolute mess! I cried at some point every day for at least two months, but the pain became less and less unbearable with time. I started noticing tangible progress. My ex wasn’t the first thing I thought of when I woke up. They were maybe the second or third thought, but it was something. I’d go entire days without crying. I wanted some sort of quick fix but time is what helped. Try to get up and do things you enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. Go for a walk, throw yourself into a hobby, get a new hobby, surround yourself with positive people, anything. I also found journaling to be incredibly therapeutic. Early on, I made a list of things that just weren’t working in the relationship and when I felt overwhelmed with sadness or anger, I’d pull it out and read it. Keeping busy is great for distraction, but also allow yourself time to just feel and process things.

I honestly don't find it too hard not to call or text him when i'm in sad/mourning mode, but when I feel joy and excitement is when I want to call him or message him the most. I just want to share it with him.

I can't stop thinking about how he's managing or if he's even coping at all. I coped by crying for 3 days straight and then turning to doing hobbies I enjoy again, going for walks, talking to friends, meditating, therapy. I'm scared he's drinking his feelings away. I'm scared because he's the kind of person that buries his feelings, he's not going to get over it (maybe even choosing not to get over it) and it's going to effect his future relationships. I'm scared that his conclusion from this is that he's not good enough. I know I can't control all this, but it's hard.

I loved him more than anything, but my fear of how he's coping is probably why it was best I ended the relationship. I wanted to grow, he doesn't want to. I can't force that.

I went to my appointment at 12 weeks and learned baby had no heartbeat and was measuring 10 weeks. My husband and I were heart broken! I recently had my first period after having a D&amp;C, which started on June 11th and lasted about 5 days. I have never really tracked my ovulation before but would really like to ttc soon so I decided to try the ovulation strips and I’ve done some research and have looking for signs. Well my apps that I  use says ovulation this week, one says today and the other says Sunday. Ok, well I started noticing my CM was matching the description for ovulation on Tuesday but only lasted 2 days. When I did the ovulation test it didn’t show much. I have done it daily all week and haven’t gotten a positive result. Could I have missed it or maybe I didn’t ovulate? Also, I was diagnosed with PCOS a few years back but my cycle was pretty consistent before my last pregnancy. I’m trying not to stress about it but it’s something I can’t get out of my head. I’m hoping if I get a better understanding, maybe it will help me. I appreciate any guidance I can get!",h2zwo6b,"I'm sorry for your loss. It can take one or even a few cycles after a loss to get back to your normal cycle lengths. So no need to worry! 
It's frustrating when the OPK strips don't match up with the math or your CM or your temp.

 Instead of ovulation day, I like to predict my ""fertile week"" and try to have sex every other day during that week. It's less stressful for both me and my husband than narrowing it down to The Day.","target:

Well my apps that I  use says ovulation this week, one says today and the other says Sunday. Ok, well I started noticing my CM was matching the description for ovulation on Tuesday but only lasted 2 days. When I did the ovulation test it didn’t show much. I have done it daily all week and haven’t gotten a positive result. Could I have missed it or maybe I didn’t ovulate? Also, I was diagnosed with PCOS a few years back but my cycle was pretty consistent before my last pregnancy. I’m trying not to stress about it but it’s something I can’t get out of my head. I’m hoping if I get a better understanding, maybe it will help me. I appreciate any guidance I can get!

observer:

I'm sorry for your loss. It can take one or even a few cycles after a loss to get back to your normal cycle lengths. So no need to worry! 
It's frustrating when the OPK strips don't match up with the math or your CM or your temp.

 Instead of ovulation day, I like to predict my ""fertile week"" and try to have sex every other day during that week.

I’m 33 and I experienced my first (and hopefully only) miscarriage of my first pregnancy in April. I was devastated and so lost. It was so crazy to have gone through such a high and then such a low in so little time. I was about 8-10wks along. 

When I was pregnant my doctor found a kind of big ovarian cyst. It hasn’t been getting bigger, but hasn’t reduced in size either. And it sounds like the best, and most sensible, thing for me to do is schedule a surgery to get it taken care of so I can experience my next pregnancy with fewer concerns. 

The problem that I’m experiencing is 1) the frustration in scheduling with doctors…I feel like it’s taking forever for me to get appointments to even schedule a surgery. I hate how small and insignificant the healthcare system makes me feel. 

And 2) I am so frustrated with the wait to try getting pregnant again. I know, I could probably still ttc with the cyst, but I also just want to take care of my own health first. 

Adding to this frustration is that it seems like everyone is pregnant. Worse yet, a family member recently announced their pregnancy even after years of saying they were disinterested in having kids.

I sometimes feel guilty for feeling so terrible about my last miscarriage 2 weeks ago.,when others are dealing with awful things, but my sister reminded me- even though there will probably always be someone who has it worse, always- no matter what your situation, it does not invalidate your own pain, your own grief and loss is real and you have every right to feel what you feel as you try and cope with it.

It sounds like you are definitely doing the right thing looking after your own health before you ttc again, but I completely understand what you are feeling with the waiting . And feeling like you’re just another number in the medical world. Waiting for appointments, waiting for surgery then waiting for a new cycle etc etc… the waiting is so hard. After all of my miscarriages the desperate, burning, all consuming need to try again straight away is something I can’t even explain or put into words. I was so anxious to be pregnant again that it feels like a physical pain , but I know it’s a feeling that many people here will know too well. 
Any set back, any delay feels unbearable., like wasted time as the clock ticks relentlessly.
I hope you get your surgery date set soon so at least you get a sort of time frame for when you can ttc again xx",2.848453640937805,2.020820498466492,3.2884042263031006,2.346400260925293,3.1485631465911865,2.006832838058472,2.43963360786438,3.387105941772461,1.8984587788581848,2.7066394090652466,3.038566827774048,2.4515035152435303,3.676502704620361,3.143968343734741,2.325807571411133,2.2173010110855103,3.2451696395874023,3.541719675064087,3.7657973766326895,4.19340968132019,3.7106544971466064,3.3982298374176025

My husband died 3 weeks ago from brain cancer. He was 31, and we’ve been together for 6 years, married for one. 
I was the one taking care of him full-time for the past year and a half since he got sick, and the last 3 months were just terrible. His family was of no help and are actually making my life even harder now. I feel like I’m not even able to grieve him.
When I thought things couldn’t possibly get any worse, I found out that he cheated on me on at least one occasion a couple of months before he got sick, with a fully elaborate plan where he rented out a place for the night when I was visiting my siblings. He slept with an older woman (40-45), i have no idea who she is. 
I loved him so much, I gave him my life, I stopped studying and working to care for him when his family wouldn’t even visit him, it was a 24/7 job, I’m exhausted. And now I’m just angry and sad and confused. He’s not even here for me to yell at him! How could he do that to me! I feel like my life with him was a lie, that he only stayed with me because he needed me to take care of him. He had a lot of time to come clean or clear his conscience but never did! 
How do I move on from this? I feel like I never even knew him.. I thought he was the best thing that ever happened to me but now I think maybe he was the worst thing to happen and I wish I never loved him. The worst part is that I probably would have forgiven him if he told me..

EDIT: Thank you everyone for putting in the time to tell me your story and to give me much needed advice.
I decided to tell my therapist (I was too embarrassed to tell him or anyone else) and I hope I can start working on myself and on forgiving him.. for now I feel like my memories of our life together are tarnished, but I hope I can get them back at some point. It’ll eat me up inside if I lose them 
What a weird life..",h28g1d4,"I think if you would have forgiven him when he was alive, then it's probably the right choice to forgive him now. I don't think it would have been right for him to tell you while he was sick and you were caring for him, and he probably knew he had made a mistake and hoped to spare you the hurt you are now feeling.

I found out things about my husband after he died that have been very hard to accept, but I don't have a choice--they are facts, and I have to just adjust my perspective of him. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. As others have said, you'll have a broad range of feelings, and they're all valid.

People are complex, and we make bad choices sometimes. I hope when I die that anything anyone who loves me finds out about me doesn't make them love me less, or believe that I loved them less. I'm not perfect, and my husband wasn't perfect, and that is how I am coping with it. Wishing you peace as you navigate your labyrinth.","target:

I don't think it would have been right for him to tell you while he was sick and you were caring for him, and he probably knew he had made a mistake and hoped to spare you the hurt you are now feeling.

I found out things about my husband after he died that have been very hard to accept, but I don't have a choice--they are facts, and I have to just adjust my perspective of him. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. As others have said, you'll have a broad range of feelings, and they're all valid.

People are complex, and we make bad choices sometimes. I hope when I die that anything anyone who loves me finds out about me doesn't make them love me less, or believe that I loved them less. I'm not perfect, and my husband wasn't perfect, and that is how I am coping with it.

I just don’t know how to deal with any of it..
My husband died 3 weeks ago from brain cancer. He was 31, and we’ve been together for 6 years, married for one. 
I was the one taking care of him full-time for the past year and a half since he got sick, and the last 3 months were just terrible. His family was of no help and are actually making my life even harder now. I feel like I’m not even able to grieve him.
When I thought things couldn’t possibly get any worse, I found out that he cheated on me on at least one occasion a couple of months before he got sick, with a fully elaborate plan where he rented out a place for the night when I was visiting my siblings. He slept with an older woman (40-45), i have no idea who she is. 
I loved him so much, I gave him my life, I stopped studying and working to care for him when his family wouldn’t even visit him, it was a 24/7 job, I’m exhausted. And now I’m just angry and sad and confused. He’s not even here for me to yell at him! How could he do that to me! I feel like my life with him was a lie, that he only stayed with me because he needed me to take care of him. He had a lot of time to come clean or clear his conscience but never did! 
How do I move on from this? I feel like I never even knew him.. I thought he was the best thing that ever happened to me but now I think maybe he was the worst thing to happen and I wish I never loved him. The worst part is that I probably would have forgiven him if he told me..

EDIT: Thank you everyone for putting in the time to tell me your story and to give me much needed advice.
I decided to tell my therapist (I was too embarrassed to tell him or anyone else) and I hope I can start working on myself and on forgiving him.. for now I feel like my memories of our life together are tarnished, but I hope I can get them back at some point. It’ll eat me up inside if I lose them

i did everything I could, I saw a specialist at some point and thought I was feeling better, I tried taking some time to care about myself and boost my self esteem, I tried seeing other people but at the end of the day,  it's just me feeling blue because i miss him.

I know I shouldn't and the break up was terrible, he said a lot of bad things to me and hurt me and I made some mistakes too. But something inside me is only focusing on the good parts of this relationship and want him back.

He blocked me everywhere so I am not able to communicate with him and ask him for a second chance and I probably shouldn't cause he hurt me way too much but I am unable to thing of anything else or be attracted to anyone else.

I really loved him and I can't forget how I felt when I was with him. I want to share everything with him and make it up for us.

But it's okay to miss people even if they weren't good for you, because at the time, you didn't see it that way. 

Let yourself feel what you want to feel without judgement. We gain control in these situations when we give up control, not when we wrestle for it.

It's been a week since my hysteroscopy for retained product, and it's been a little over 2 months since my actual MMC. 

It just doesn't get better. I'm sick of my partner asking me what's wrong like he doesn't know. I'm sick of him telling me to ""get over it"". I'm sick of him telling me to get back to normal. 

I'm sick of being expected to just be fucking fine like I didn't lose my goddamn child and like I'm not still physically dealing with this miscarriage. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I'm bitter about everyone with children. I'm bitter about my stepdaughter which makes me feel fucking horrible. I don't even want to be in a relationship anymore. I just wanted a fucking baby. And I just want to be left alone. 

I'm just hopeless and done.

I continuously tell my sister not to let my life consume her or to stop her from doing what she needs to for herself.

It's been so tough on her but we are all so helpless.  So much of this journey she has to do alone.  Don't feel guilty that they are doing things for you, if they are anything like me then they just feel like they want to help and support you.

Whether it's making you tea or doing your cleaning, it makes them feel useful.  My mum is very independent and just getting her to let me make her tea is an achievement.  Equally, it's hard to let your family do things for you because you want to scream and shout in anger instead of making THEM feel OK by letting them help.

Do what's best for you, but communicate with them.  ""Hey, what would help me most right now is if we didn't talk about cancer as it will take my mind off it"" - tell them what you need, let them give you it.

Good luck.","target:

383,383,300,BipolarSOs,t3_oaayi2,oaayi2,"Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him?

Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him? I don't know how the best way to talk to him, like approaching it for his own benefit or bringing the consideration of his loved ones in as well. Any tips and advice will help, as well as any literature or media that would help me understand the dynamics as a SO. Thanks

I instantly regretted it, and it made me realize how much i love my ex and how great she was, but now i fear that she will never take me back:(

And what hurts the most is the thought of her being devestated because of something i did. The only thing that is worse than being hurt yourself, is to know that you deeply hurt someone you love. Should i tell my ex how i feel about the whole thing and hope for understanding?

He was little over a year old. I remember the day i saw him wandering around in the neighbourhood , dude was starving to death but i brought him in. Within a day or two i managed to earn his trust. I've always been so indecisive all my life but rescuing him was the best decision i've ever made . I've 3 other cats but they are more close to my other siblings , this guy was my battle buddy. I went through so much this last year but this guy was always by my side . Every time i'd come back home only to see him waiting for me on the front porch. I played video games for long hours and he'd always sleep in my lap . I've had my finals not too long ago and the only thing that helped me push through was my cat .  
On Friday , i lost a great relative and was already in so much pain when my sister called to tell me about Lee. He was meowing like crazy and he could barely walk. It took me an hour to get back home and i took him straight to the vet , the x-ray and ultra sound apparently showed nothing . He gave him some pain killers and meds for constipation. After a few hours , Lee was able to stand and walk around a bit , we thought its a good sign. Yesterday around 7pm , he started to act the same way and within an hour he became lethargic again. Then his body temps dropped massively , i tried to contact every vet there is in town but none of them responded. Around 2 am ,he died in my arms.  I haven't been able to stop crying and sleep. I don't know how i am going to survive . I can already see myself losing the battle in the near future. I cant concentrate on anything . I failed my best friend and the guilt is just killing me now . idk if i can go a day without him. Any advice on how to cope with this? please .",2.5672495365142822,1.701495885848999,3.327679395675659,2.5643616914749146,2.9433356523513794,2.3031466007232666,2.2037006616592407,3.248734712600708,1.7166784405708313,2.5221564769744877,3.2432751655578613,1.7128105759620669,3.919687986373901,3.1476433277130127,2.086839199066162,1.3301941752433777,3.078542470932007,3.639749050140381,3.7157950401306152,3.167263984680176,787,0,"I lost my sweet Duchess a few days ago.

OP it’s really easy to think like you do towards anyone who responds how your Dad has - but he isn’t just any person - he has dementia.

His brain is essentially dying and in completely unpredictable random ways. Keep that in the **forefront** of your mind before you lose it.

He could be simply afraid of falling so feels safer with his walking cane. Dementia and meds can cause dizziness so naturally they lose confidence in their sense of balance.

No matter what always remember and never forget his brain is randomly dying - there is no rhyme of reason for literally anything going forward. He will be saying and acting in ways that will be a surprise to you. He is possibly aware that something isn’t right with him and it’s like his private nightmare 

All you can do is keep him safe and validate how he feels and try to distract him towards something else should he be getting himself into spin. 

He is changing and if you can step back and observe how he changes it may make things a lot easier for you. Rather than wishing he’d just adjust or get back to who you know him to be. Instead think ‘my dads changing so let’s see how this new dad unfolds’ 

I don’t know if that’s helpful I’m just rattling on. I remember a therapist who said to me in relation to my mother who also has vascular dementia ‘any change in her behaviour is a change, she’s not being difficult she’s just becoming someone else you don’t know - yet’

I had to move in with her because she ran through an entire companies caretakers. They all kept quitting because they didn’t want to work with her. She is extremely abusive. 

Social Services came out yesterday with a Pallative Nurse. The nurse said she had never seen anyone as angry and abusive as my Grandma. That really gave me validation for what I have been going through. 

I’ll update this later: hopefully with good news, but who knows.

Update: APS did not arrive yesterday. I am not sure if they will be arriving today.

Currently waiting for APS to arrive to take my Grandma into a facility. My mother died when I was young. I am her last living relative. 

I had to move in with her because she ran through an entire companies caretakers. They all kept quitting because they didn’t want to work with her. She is extremely abusive. 

Social Services came out yesterday with a Pallative Nurse. The nurse said she had never seen anyone as angry and abusive as my Grandma. That really gave me validation for what I have been going through. 

I’ll update this later: hopefully with good news, but who knows.

1. I saw she didnt care anymore and she became very harsh. All my nightmares brought to life. She knew my weaknesses and fears and brought them to life. Step 1 was to accept what happened no matter how much it hurt. Cry, scream, pray, all that stuff will give you some sort of piece of mind.

2. She changed her # so it made it easier but i still had her email. Block everything. If possible, do what i did and just delete your social media. I would inly recommend this if it gives you peace though. I deleted mine and have been off social media ever since for time to heal the wounds. 

3. Do not contact her.

4. Tell your friends or acquaintances that you do not want to know anything about her so to please not tell you if they see somewhere, no. Nothing. Peace of mind. We must let her fade away. 

5. Focus on yourself. Surround yourself with goals. Reach your full potential.

Ps: 3 weeks after i strted doing this, she contacted me from her new # begging me to talk to her. I never replied to one single text. Sometimes I wonder what she may have wanted.

399,399,359,BipolarSOs,t3_oaayi2,oaayi2,"Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him? I don't know how the best way to talk to him, like approaching it for his own benefit or bringing the consideration of his loved ones in as well. Any tips and advice will help, as well as any literature or media that would help me understand the dynamics as a SO. Thanks",h3gkemm,"BP and addiction can go hand in hand.  Your only choice is to be honest.  Tell him you are afraid for his health, you want to make this work, but you get scared and don't always know what to do when he drinks.

Before you speak with him, think about the boundaries that you want to set.  Maybe you don't want him drinking around you, or there perhaps there are other things you need from him.  Have a sense of what those things are, and relay your boundaries.

Lastly, know that his response to this convo is not about you, it is about him.  If he responds with yelling and screaming, not your fault, his ego isn't ready to hear it.  If he is understanding and wants to do the work, it wasn't magic delivery, it was him being ready to hear what you have to say, and put his ego aside to build a relationship.

He is very lucky to have someone that cares, but you owe him nothing.

Best of luck.","target:

I have developed servere anxiety according to My Doctor after she passed, i Get anxiety attacks and completely shut down, This has totally messed me up mentally. The love i had for her was the most special thing, i would kill to be able to see her again, but thats not going to happen and i can’t accept it, no Way. How could I? 6 years old and she gets a brutal cancer tumor that kills her in weeks. Why? I Ask myself that every day when i collapse in the shower and cry My eyes out every morning while calling her name in desperation. Sometimes i pretend she is here and i put a bowl of food on the floor and wait for her to eat it, it never gets eaten and that kills me Even more inside everytime. there must have been something i coulve done sooner, bur it was to late. I hate This. And i hate the fact that i Will never see her again, This Will haunt me forever.

I think i might die from This, i actually think i Will die in My sleep soon. My Heartbeat is completely out off sync and i can’t breathe normally anymore. I think i am dying from Grief.",h2u0z1j,I am so sorry for your loss. I'm glad you posted this because it's really important to talk to people about these feelings. You are not alone. I have lost many loved ones the past 5 years but my dog passed 10 days ago and it almost feels worse. He was my emotional support animal because I already had crazy anxiety and depression and he helped me. We went everywhere together and having to adapt to life without him is unbearable. I cry on the way home from work each day because he's not with me and I feel like that and the time before I go to bed is the worst because I'm not keeping myself busy.

Its been 42 days now, i try to act fine and normal, Im still nice and polite, but on the inside Im destroyed. I have developed servere anxiety according to My Doctor after she passed, i Get anxiety attacks and completely shut down, This has totally messed me up mentally. The love i had for her was the most special thing, i would kill to be able to see her again, but thats not going to happen and i can’t accept it, no Way. How could I? 6 years old and she gets a brutal cancer tumor that kills her in weeks. Why? I Ask myself that every day when i collapse in the shower and cry My eyes out every morning while calling her name in desperation. Sometimes i pretend she is here and i put a bowl of food on the floor and wait for her to eat it, it never gets eaten and that kills me Even more inside everytime. there must have been something i coulve done sooner, bur it was to late. I hate This. And i hate the fact that i Will never see her again, This Will haunt me forever.

I think i might die from This, i actually think i Will die in My sleep soon. My Heartbeat is completely out off sync and i can’t breathe normally anymore. I think i am dying from Grief.

Cancer is an incredibly scary and overwhelming diagnosis. He’s in the period of waiting to get treated and that time is so very difficult, it’s hard to explain. It’s stressful and gut wrenching and the what if’s are on your mind constantly as the patient.

It is always hard to try to understand your feelings or even the feelings of others, which is why your family reacts the way it did. Mine still reacts that exact way.

I appreciate that you're not botteling up your emotions.

Is there any way you can get in contact with docs or something like that, like where are u from?-...some healthcaresystems overlook mental illnesses sady :(

Grief isn't a step by step process and suddenly we're ok. Sometimes it rears its ugly head, grabs us by the throat and wrings out more emotion until you feel shattered and empty all over again. 

The only thing we can do is to remember the good times. I wish I could tell you that eventually you will get over this, but I can't. What I can say is that these shattering moments will come less and less often.

I lost my mum over 13 years ago and still  think of her nearly everyday. And, particularly at those moments I would have loved to be able to share with her. And at times the grief can still feel overwhelming. But, then I make myself think of some of the whacky things she would do and it makes me smile and feel a little better. 

((((Hugs))))

Love you.

Second I did the same thing. Begged back. Got nowhere. Got no response. There was a reason why it ended. Because after some time i realized i had zero care in the world about her. Whereas before i was constantly thinkimg about her and really distressed. When I realized ""even if she asked me back I would NEVER go back"". That is such a liberating feeling. Free.

Another cycle of this. It still hurts but this time I did not beg her back and just respected her wishes. 7 months and I have to keep going.","target:

I feel good about myself, I feel more better and healthy. Now when I think about her, I don’t even feel sad, I just laugh about it.

I needed to let this off my chest because man…I FEEL FUCKING GREAT. ONTO ANOTHER 4 MONTHS :) 

Love you all! Virtual hug to talk of you, you’re going to be ok, you’re loved

Yup. I remember this feeling. It WAS great. When you realize you have ZERO attraction or care in the world about your ex. I have been through this twice already so dont worry all you who think it will never end and they were the ""only"" one for you. The first time was after 3 months and this was a 4 and a half year relationship. I begged her back and cried. Lol. That was funny when i think about it now. After 3 months its like a cloud lifted from me and I realized i wasn't even THAT into her. To the point where i celebrated on an actual day when I realized I was in fact happier without her.  Second I did the same thing. Begged back. Got nowhere. Got no response. There was a reason why it ended. Because after some time i realized i had zero care in the world about her. Whereas before i was constantly thinkimg about her and really distressed. When I realized ""even if she asked me back I would NEVER go back"". That is such a liberating feeling. Free.

Another cycle of this. It still hurts but this time I did not beg her back and just respected her wishes. 7 months and I have to keep going.",2.455078125,1.7626953125,2.09375,"[[9, 35, 'Objective Experience', 'It’s been 4 and 1/2 months'], [40, 54, 'Pleasantness', 'I FEEL SO GOOD'], [126, 237, 'Certainty', 'Trust me when I say YOU will feel better after a few months, I’ve been on no contact with her since the breakup'], [242, 307, 'Self-Other Agency', 'I don’t even care anymore at this point of her reaching out back…'], [307, 335, 'Certainty', 'I know for sure I ain’t lol.'], [56, 125, 'Objective Experience', 'I can’t remember when was the last time I cried about her leaving me.'], [337, 394, 'Pleasantness', 'I feel good about myself, I feel more better and healthy.'], [395, 468, 'Pleasantness', 'Now when I think about her, I don’t even feel sad, I just laugh about it.'], [516, 537, 'Pleasantness', 'I FEEL FUCKING GREAT.'], [470, 516, 'Anticipated Effort', 'I needed to let this off my chest because man…'], [538, 562, 'Anticipated Effort', 'ONTO ANOTHER 4 MONTHS :)'], [655, 684, 'Objective Experience', 'Yup.

I got pregnant in February with my first but it ended in March. The baby stopped growing around 5 and a half weeks. I was so beyond excited for that baby. I didn’t think I’d lose it. I never thought that would be me. 

It hurt but I picked myself back up and tried again. I got pregnant again in May. My hcg level were checked this time. They weren’t last time. They seemed lower than most people’s but were still doubling so I just told myself a second miscarriage in a row is unlikely and to not worry. Then symptoms disappeared. Over the weekend I started cramping pretty badly. I felt so bad I could barely get out of bad. Then early this morning I started lightly spotting. It stopped for now. I’m going to contact my doctor today. But I’m upset and angry. I can’t even enjoy being pregnant this time because of my previous miscarriage. I’m constantly worrying. 

I know there’s a chance the baby be okay but it wasn’t last time. Even when I was full on bleeding I still had hope. I’m scared to get my hopes up. 

I thought getting pregnant would be one of the best experiences of my life. I was wrong. All of this is so stressful. I hate every second of it.

If we lose this one, we’ll keep trying. I know once I hold my baby in arms everything will be worth it. There’s a baby meant for my family and that it’ll come when it’s meant to. So I’m trying to be patient. I’m trying so hard.

Don't get down on yourself because you're feeling upset. We all wanted this to go differently but not all of us get that as our reality and that sucks.

Its been more of a reflective day than a celebratory day for me.  Its rarely a happy day for me.

I miss my deceased father and grandfathers.  I regret that I was not more appreciative and loving towards them when they were alive.  My dad died when I was 21.  He was cheated out of his grandchildren, I lost what could have been a great adult relationship with my dad, and my kids lost out, too, on what would've been a great grandfather.

My two kids love me and they are great.  But I always feel like I've let them down when I reflect on Father's Day what kind of father I've been.

I see other fathers out having great times and playing up today as their special day. But then I have FOMO and am jealous about how they approach the day and experience it.

I don't like the attention because I don't feel like I deserve it.

I try to put on a good face.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Then I feel worse when I realize that I've spoiled the day.

Its the same on my birthday.

And then I  want to make next year better, to go out and make lasting memories for my family, to have more fun, to be more adventurous.  But then the social anxiety, insecurities, fear and other negative thoughts just put a stop to it.

And one year from now I'll likely have the same shitty Father's Day.",2.552531599998474,2.43189549446106,2.723482728004456,2.1999844312667847,2.6766093969345093,1.9363547563552856,2.4242933988571167,2.6055911779403687,1.6308459639549255,2.575672507286072,3.135886907577514,2.067870855331421,3.2054715156555176,3.0710880756378174,1.5400717854499817,1.7887320518493652,2.643624782562256,3.119402408599853,3.577279806137085,3.666048526763916,885,0,"Hey man, it seems that this holiday reminds you of your own dad and him passing away.
