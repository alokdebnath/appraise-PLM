0,0,2.0,I'm in my last year of Uni &amp; Working to support myself &amp; Commuting home 2-3 times per week to help with some family issues &amp; trying to maintain a minimal social life so I don't feel alone throughout this burnout (ie. the only hanging out rn is while studying),"I ran on a schedule like that my last semester of university. Sometimes it's necessary, but try to cut out some of those responsibilities if you can. Maybe only 1 time a week to family? It is your last year so there's not much longer, you'll get through this!

Start eating every 2-3 hours. I kept a bunch of protien bars in my bag and set a timer to remind me to eat one. I wasn't hungry because of the stress, but your body is hungry because it needs fuel to do all these stressful things. Try and eat as healthy as possible.

I get having sleep problems too, I had the same thing when I was in your situation. Taking melatonin before bed helped me a lot. But also, I had a timer set and forced myself to get in bed and try to sleep for at least 4 hours a night.

I gained so much weight when my dad was diagnosed with ALS. I drove to see him every single day, ate in the car, ate with him, ate in the car on the way back, cried to sleep. He passed away almost two years ago and I finally feel less depressed about it and have been slowly changing my lifestyle. I refused to document my weight until I was at 220 and now Im 190. I finally feel like adjusting my lifestlye/eating habits is reasonable and that it hs become achievable. Tracking my calories has made me make much better decisions about my nutritional intake, even planning accordingly for special event/bigger than normal dinners, and giving myself some flexibility with a few high calorie days every once and awhile.

I'm a huge fan of single player, narratively strong stuff that includes everything from experimental interactive fiction to point and click adventure games.

I was referring to my original post as I’m usually a fairly rational person but Tim’s story struck a nerve that resonated with me. In addition, I am terribly sorry to hear that you have lost so many people to themselves, it truly is the most painful thing to lose someone this way, it makes you feel so responsible - like guilt for not being able to stop it.

You should take respite in the fact that you can’t own the worlds problems and even if it seems like it’s ‘all your fault’ think about this: when was the last time you made a massive life decision on a single factor alone. I nearly took my life once, but I’d lost everything and even then I thought about it for a long time. Most people are troubled by an inner narrative that can consume them and it’s rarely external changes that make it unbearable, suicide is almost always an internal battle.

I was referring to my original post as I’m usually a fairly rational person but Tim’s story struck a nerve that resonated with me. In addition, I am terribly sorry to hear that you have lost so many people to themselves, it truly is the most painful thing to lose someone this way, it makes you feel so responsible - like guilt for not being able to stop it.

You should take respite in the fact that you can’t own the worlds problems and even if it seems like it’s ‘all your fault’ think about this: when was the last time you made a massive life decision on a single factor alone. I nearly took my life once, but I’d lost everything and even then I thought about it for a long time. Most people are troubled by an inner narrative that can consume them and it’s rarely external changes that make it unbearable, suicide is almost always an internal battle.

I spoke to you a few weeks ago about this issue I think, so this has been going on for awhile. I'm concerned for your health, as this is a lot of mental strain for anyone to deal with, and especially for such a long time. 

Its not your fault for posting photos, or for making an identifiable name. In the end it is the stalkers fault, 100%. They are harassing you, straight and simple. This is illegal and against reddit rules.

My situation: 

- moved out of my parents, dropped out of university. Living on my own, in a city where I know just my colleagues from work that I found

- I have been scouted by a modelling agency and now after about 2-3 months, they are sending me to China for 3 months. (from march to may)

- now, I am still skinny motherfucker but gained some weight and strength and a little bit of fat. they want me to cut it down so I look more shredded. And that's what makes me a bit depressed/anxious.

I am about 5'11"" and just 155 lbs. Now I have to cut and will become even skinnier. But yeah, I have to accept that, it's a part of the job. But still, it bugs me. I will be there for 3 months and I think there won't be any consistent gym access for consistent routine and I won't be really able to cut/bulk there. I am afraid that I will lose all my muscle and all my hard work will go to shit. 

And now, I don't even know how to approach that weight loss I need to do. Should I just cut for these 2 months prior? Or do a recomp? :( 

I don't even know what I am asking or what I want to hear.

Sorry guys, I am just lonely and don't have anyone to talk this through and this sub has been my family for a long time and I am here everyday :( (yes, this is throwaway account, I am active on my main account here)

You can't stay in the shape they want you to be without the proper tools, so I'd imagine they'd provide some kind of support/advice as far as nearby gyms and good places to buy food to keep your diet in check. They might even comp your gym costs if you just ask.

27,27,3.0,"So what *is* the answer?

I'm married to a woman with depression.  We just celebrated our ten year anniversary.  I've tried everything.  I've tried the rational approach, which I understand now why it might not be helpful.  I've tried the empathetic ""Want to talk?  If not, that's OK - I'm still here for you"" approach and just sitting there with her and being with her, letting her know I love her and I'm sorry for what she's going through.  She's tried therapy and prescriptions.  We've tried couple's therapy together.  We've tried spending more time alone together to focus on us.  We've tried spending more time with other people in order to try to spend *less* time alone and run from our problems.  She's tried going back to school in order to get her degree and increase her self-worth (she's always been insecure about not having a degree).  I've tried finally relenting and just saying ""Yes"" to everything she wants - we bought a new house in a new area like she wanted, bought her the car she always wanted, replaced literally all of our furniture, etc.

And yet it's only gotten worse.  I'm at my emotional breaking point.  Nothing's ever enough.  No treatment or potential solution has helped.  I'm a flawed human being, but I'll do my absolute best to be as compassionate, available and patient as I possibly can be, while still trying to take time for myself - but the moment I take a mis-step (didn't read her mind to see what she wanted in that moment, said or did something dumb, can't comply with some demand of hers, etc.), it's a monumental explosion.  I ""never listen,"" ""never show compassion.""  She ""shouldn't have to tell me what she needs, because [I] should just know.""

I'm the punching bag for all her negative emotions and factors.  All the anger and frustration she can't take out on every else - I get it instead.

I love this woman.  We just celebrated our ten year anniversary.  There's nothing more I want in the world than for her to just be happy and content.  But every dissatisfaction in her life somehow ends up falling on my shoulders, and every inadequacy of mine ends up being a reason for her to break down crying and get upset with me for not being there enough for her and being a better husband.

Wtf is the answer, man.  How do you help someone that's going through this, when their first instinct is to make you the enemy?  I feel like I'm trying to save a person drowning in the ocean, and every time I try to help them put the life preserver on, they grab it and start beating me in the face with it.  I've lost all optimism at this point.  I'm defeated.  Honestly, *I'm* depressed now.

I don't actually expect any answers really.  I'm mainly typing this out as catharsis.  I can't talk to our friends or my family about it, because it doesn't seem fair to her.","Hey.  First of all, I want to say you are a good person. A strong and valiant man to do everything you can to help improve the situation.  Its easy to see how much you love this woman.  And, having these feelings is not wrong.  Its not bad.  You need to take care of yourself too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have severe manic depression.  I know I am a burden on my significant other - but one thing is pretty common.  Deep depression really doesn't manifest itself like this.  There are definitely some other issues going on with her. Anger issues. Sure she probably has depression too - but when you are depressed, you barely have energy to do anything, let alone pick fights. You withdrawal.  You become distant. that is my burden with my Significant other.  I know I push here away because its too taxing to be THAT person for them, especially when you have to maintain at a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest you go to counseling on your own. Without her. You need some clarity and someone outside of the relationship to really be able to help you see what is going on.  Alone, you will open up more and give a more truthful picture of what exactly is going on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a crush on a fellow DOT'er and we started talking on the phone and texting.  He basically told me what I wanted to hear to get me in bed with him this weekend.  Then at the end of the sexcapades he told me he did not want to date me.  I'm not putting it all on him, I am the one who acted like a stupid teenage girl desperate for a boy to like me. 

I have been suffering from depression for a while and I don't always make the best decisions when I am.  To this end, I’ve deactivated my dating profiles and have decided to focus on my health.

I feel like I should delete my reddit account.  I have deleted all my posts but for now I'm just going to take a break from reddit as a whole and if I still feel that way when I come back, I will delete then.

I wish you all well.  And kinda, so long and thanks for all the fish!

Edit: you guys are so great!!!","No. Just no on this whole damn post. 

I'm sorry about what happened, I'm sorry you're hurting. Take a breather if you need to, but if you gain something by interacting with this community then I think walking away from it is self-punishing. On a personal note I wouldn't like it one bit, anc clearly I'm not alone in feeling this way.

Whatever you do is your choice of course, but for now, change that flair. That is NOT who you are and it makes me sad to see it next to your u-name.

All this BULLSHIT with Trump and destroying everything to protect us, I'm sorry, but it's all about big pharma. The sticker we are, the more medicine we need. The life saving medicine we need is most expensive of all, and they just get richer and richer.

Non-pet owner's don't get how much they're part of the family.  Having to make that decision was the worst day of my life.  Cried like a baby.  I won't lie to you, its gonna be rough.  But my vet said something to me that I hope helps you through this: You cherish everyday with your pet, but when there are no more good days, its time to let them go.

Your job is absolutely not worth your mental health and joy for life. You are allowed to take care of yourself. If it becomes necessary for you to walk away for a bit, then you need to do that. Maybe you could think of it as a way of taking better care of your lil boss in the long run. If you’re basically the one responsible for kids’ major early learning (and you really want them to not be little assholes and be decent humans later on) then you need to be in good health mentally, physically, and emotionally. Cause we both know that some days end up being just a fucking bad day.  Think of the lil boss as a teacup, empty and ready to be filled with wonderful things; you’re the pot with the skills and knowledge and love to fill them with decent human skills. If you don’t take time to refill yourself and make sure you’re ok, you’re eventually gonna be empty and have nothing left to give. 

So, I suggest taking some time to take care of yourself. Find a therapist or counselor to speak with. Start a journal. Try yoga. Take some time and get away for a long weekend to recharge. And if you’re as close to the boss’ mom as I was lucky enough to be to mine, talk to her about it! Tell her you might need some time off or maybe some flexibility if possible as you need. A 2 year old and a newborn sounds insane enough.

46,46,1.0,It’s horrible. Something has changed over the past two months too and my primary care doctor won’t help me and I can’t afford a specialist. It’s depressing me. I would never kill myself but sometimes I just feel so hopeless because I can’t do anything with my life like a normal person. It’s been making me very upset lately and it’s the most embarrassing fucking thing ever.,"I am so sorry to hear this, because your situation sounds like mine. I am a lifelong IBS sufferer, and then last February it got A LOT worse. Just like you say here—basically couldn’t leave the house without shitting myself. Barely could make it to the bathroom on more than one occasion.  Started wondering if I needed to go on disability since I couldn’t work anymore.

52,52,1.0,"Okay, so I am not trying to take over this thread or anything, but I really feel the need to voice my experience as well. I’m a private person and would rather not even talk about it at all, but I think it’s important.

OP, I have the exact same problem. Last fall quarter (2017), my brother passed away. It was completely unexpected, and it happened in the middle of the quarter. I had to fly home even, and then I didn't get back to this state (I'm an out of state student) until the middle of November. Everyone, my academic advisors, the counselling center, told me the withdrawal people would not reject my application for the withdrawal.

Well they did. I tried to appeal, and the same woman who denied it in the first place wouldn't even give it to the wider panel, because I didn't introduce anything new for them to review. I provided a death certificate, everything. What else did they need, a picture of my crying that whole week? It was incredibly degrading, insulting, and upsetting (esp given the amount of money I pay to attend this school). At a time in my life when I was trying to be normal again, I just couldn't pursue the argument with them anymore. Impressively, they managed to make me hate life even more. So I guess they’ve accomplished something.

I've been looking into talking with the Ombudsman, so maybe you can try the same. Sorry, not trying to cause a pity party or take over your thread. But just so you know, I can completely understand where you are coming from. I know people have gotten hardship withdrawals from seasonal depression. I had a life-changing, completely unexpected, horrible nightmare happen in my life mid-quarter, and they still couldn't be bothered to send me anything (and by ""they"" I really just mean this one woman) other than robotic jargon. Essentially, they failed to recognize me as a human and didn’t even provide me with any contact info other than her email.

When I tried to ask for a human response as to why they were rejecting me, I got a runaround of basically pre-written guideline expectations. From what I gather (because they make nothing clear), and my advisor gathers, it is because my brother died before the 14th of November, and therefore I had time to withdraw of my own volition before the drop deadline. So, they reject me because of that. Literally, no one else on campus understands why they would make that decision. I wasn’t even in WA state, or even in the right state of mind, to be sorting out school work after my brother just passed away. I had to book a plane ticket and fly five hours, then there was a funeral. And grief. And do I really need to explain it to a normal person? I wasn't even sure if I wanted to drop all of my classes. I ended up getting an incomplete in one, which I finished the next quarter, then badly needed the withdrawal for the other two. I didn't know about the withdrawal deadline. And it's as if upon hearing my brother just died, I would immediately run to the internet and sort through academic deadlines. I didn't even get back to school until basically the day I would have had to drop all my classes anyway, which ultimately wouldn't have worked, because I did still want one class and the withdraw at that point would have been all or nothing I believe. I tried to explain it to them, and again, it was basically the same as talking to a robot.

Again, I might try with the Ombudsman, but it is such an upsetting experience for me to revisit. It brings me back to the worst time in my life, made worse by the school’s administration. I had just gotten back to campus, across the country from my family, and I felt so alone, alienated, and just absolutely horrible. Typing the story out right now, I am getting really upset. I'm not sure if I even should bother again for my own mental health. If you want, feel free to PM me!

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched.

Read this while sitting across from my dad having breakfast. I drove 1400 kms two days ago to surprise mom on her birthday, and am leaving again in a couple of days. Dad had to go to work now, but I plan to spend the weekend glued to his side thanks to your comment. 

Out of all my family, he's always the one I miss the most, the one I've always looked up to since I was a little girl. I just turned 30, but dad's still my hero. The most painful part of my life is feeling like a failure to him, when all I want is for him to be proud of me (I have some mental health issues).

I think he's a little bit like your dad, and I'm a little bit like you. I never really know if I'm bothering him if I ramble at him, and I never am the one to call him (he usually calls me on his way home from work, for 20 minute chats) because I know he works a lot and is always tired, so I don't want to bother him.

But whenever I hug or snuggle up to him, he seems really happy so I'm sure deep down he loves me; he's just a little awkward about expressing it, like I often am. 

Yesterday, my dad's colleague and friend sent a text to my mom saying ""I hear you two just got the greatest present!"" - which means my dad told him I came to surprise them. Thinking about it now after reading your post, it makes me feel very warm and fuzzy. Totally worth the exhaustion I currently feel :D

I never really know if I'm bothering him if I ramble at him, and I never am the one to call him (he usually calls me on his way home from work, for 20 minute chats) because I know he works a lot and is always tired, so I don't want to bother him.

But whenever I hug or snuggle up to him, he seems really happy so I'm sure deep down he loves me; he's just a little awkward about expressing it, like I often am. 

Yesterday, my dad's colleague and friend sent a text to my mom saying ""I hear you two just got the greatest present!"" - which means my dad told him I came to surprise them. Thinking about it now after reading your post, it makes me feel very warm and fuzzy. Totally worth the exhaustion I currently feel :D

This weekend we'll probably do one of our awesome father-daughter programs (something we started years ago, to make time  for just the two of us), and go watch a movie together. &lt;3",2.921018123626709,1.79716157913208,2.5622071027755737,2.3673847913742065,3.1593945026397705,2.138495922088623,2.759497284889221,2.8843328952789307,2.1197391748428345,2.3529398441314697,3.2796692848205566,2.344066023826599,3.4032633304595947,3.231691837310791,2.4927738904953003,1.789420306682587,3.359663486480713,3.871067523956299,3.897383451461792,3.85642409324646,3.7995643615722656,3.5714778900146484

My significant other doesn't want me to tell his family about it, because they won't understand. But it really wears down on me, pretending that I'm okay. 
Because I'm not okay.

As soon as we got in the car after
Christmas dinner, he told me two remarks I said that were apparently offensive. 

He said that I sounded too critical of him, when I asked him if he really cooked at the table, when he mentioned that he did. At the table, he claimed that he did cook frequently, but I swear that he doesn't. He eats a lot of takeout, and I don't like that. 

His cousin asked him what he got for Christmas, which prompted me to ask if he got money from his uncle again this year. Only a few days ago, he mentioned it was the Christmas gift he most looked forward to. He said that it made him look bad that I asked him that. 

I didn't mean to be overly critical. I was genuinely curious as to if he does cook often and as to what he received this Christmas. I understand that in my culture, we tend to be more blunt and open about money, but I can't change that to accommodate him over night.

I started crying as soon as he grilled me, because I tried really hard to look presentable and act normal and give everyone thoughtful presents. He didn't even ask me how I felt before telling me what he did wrong, though he knew I was nervous to come. 

It was way too much.

Its been the worst semester ever – in terms of events that have happened to me, and how that has in turn impacted things.

I have been witness to a shooting, my mother died unexpectedly and I was party to several traumatic incidents whilst on placement. None of which I have realised had affected me until all of my grades for my assignments have come through. I know now that my coping strategy of using my course work hasn’t been the healthiest strategy, it has come at the expense of my mental well-being. I struggle to feel well rested or accomplished at the end of a day, with my patience and tolerance being shorter than ever before – all signs of a subconscious that is struggling to comprehend what has happened in such a short time frame. With an increase in anxiety and inability to focus for prolonged periods of time, something which has never happened to me before.

Small things which are easily fixable have been missed which has resulted in me being in a position where on paper I am technically unable to pass the course. All of these minor things I would usually have been fine with, had nothing happened to me. I’ve been struggling for five years to get in the position where I could get this close to passing my degree. After having been through cyfs care growing up and struggling into the transition into independence, its super frustrating to get this close and find that events outside my control have been the final straw to prevent me from passing.

I have been told that in special circumstances things can sometimes be considered, in reading the course materials allowed I came across this:

“*AEG or Aegrotat is a pass granted to a student who for reasons of personal illness,*

*injury or other exceptional circumstances beyond that*

*student’s control, is either absent from, or is able to claim*

*impaired performance in, an item of assessment. An aegrotat*

*pass will only be awarded where the Faculty Leader is satisfied*

*on the basis of the student’s achievement in assessment tasks*

*already completed, that the student would have passed the*

*assessment/course had it not been for the particular personal*

*circumstances involved”*

I guess I should apply for this, only trouble being I’ve not sought assistance from the support services before last week. Our final registration exam is fast approaching on the 20th I need this all sorted out well before so I can have a chance to get my mental state sorted before sitting the registration exam.

I needed to vent, but I guess it remains in the control of the institute – unsure how I feel about that though.

The person who would be making that decision is away until the 12th of November, just adding to the stress as well.","Sorry to hear of your mum's passing and your loss.

","So sorry to hear about it. Cool thing about surgery is it’s over before you know it. As soon as you “go to sleep” it feels like you wake up a second later. Hardest part is getting through the anxiety leading up to the surgery. Remind yourself everything is going to be okay. 

When you arrive at surgery place and you start freaking out, tell them you are anxious and they might give you something to calm your nerves before you are fully sedated. 

If you got nauseous from anesthesia after you had your wisdom removed or in general get nauseous easily (even car sick easily), TELL anesthesiologist and they will put a tiny patch behind your ear. 

Lastly, I tried a Lush body conditioner yesterday and almost fell in the shower it was so slippery. I think it’s pretty common and products should include a warning.",2.0,1.0,150,1,"I'm the biggest dumbass and slipped in my shower and broke my wrist.

Yep indeed I have been through some family issues regarding cancer and lost of loved ones, but I am trying to get over it. It had a great impact in my life (especially because I was a teenager at the time), and probably I am depressed. Anyway, I tried to do my best to reach “goals” in life, always been a very good student, graduated in time with top grades and academic honors.

My dad passed away when I was in my early 20s from cancer and I only recently was able to tackle some of the deep rooted issues until my early 30s (through the help of a therapist).

As for career, unless you are in a place where you can comfortably afford losing your job, I'd suggest do enough and not get fired in the meantime. I'd suggest you talk to your boss about it (if you feel that's appropriate).

one day I can pull through it all...even it seems really bleak, I know that giving up is just gonna make things worse. I'm certain that sooner or later it'll pay off...eventually. In the meantime, I have Heroes and my Discord community whom I love - the games is one of the few things that can still bring me joy and I'm glad that I'm part of this fun community, despite me not actually doing too much.

Really sorry to hear about how difficult things have been. You're right in that mental health services can be quite costly, to be fair not just financially, but in terms of time commitments as well. But oftentimes, it can be a great investment for yourself and you can see a positive impact on yourself for years to come. 

There are some good options that you can explore though. Check out government hospitals, if you get a referral letter from a klinik kesihatan or a GP, therapy goes for RM5 per session. Alternatively, try checking out [sols247.org](https://sols247.org) as a good alternative. They have sliding scale therapy fees, so they can adjust according to what you're able to afford as well.

There will always be people out there who care. Just that sometimes, we gotta work a little to find out  where and who they are. Don't give up buddy, hang in there.

98,98,1.0,"I would agree with this. I think That Dragon Cancer is a great example that I will happily trot out as 'using games as a medium to tell an emotive and impactful story', it's... not really a story I want to experience. 

Which is funny, because I should be the ideal target audience for this game. I'm a huge fan of single player, narratively strong stuff that includes everything from experimental interactive fiction to point and click adventure games. My mom got cancer five years ago, and one of my closest uncles died from cancer as well. 

But that's *exactly* why I don't want to go near the game. At the end of the day, effective as it was, I'm not getting anything out of it except a general sense of depression and sadness. For me – and, I suspect, for a lot of other people as well – games are very much escapism and a way to experience things I can't in real life. I don't know a lot of people who want to experience a kid dying from cancer, though. 

I'd say a good counterexample would be something like, say, Among the Sleep. It's a first person survival adventure game, you play as a child, you explore a story that's frankly *pretty fucking dark*, and that did a TON better than That Dragon Cancer.

By using allegory of the emotional journey against some other story telling you suddenly have a deep game that will not only glue to the creator's specific situation but many others that follow the same rhythm.

I flat out told them--very nicely--that I would be using gloves to protect MY hands from discomfort and further damage. Period. There is nothing to be ashamed of in taking care of yourself.

103,103,1.0,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, about to turn 4. Some policemen showed up at the door to my house, talked to my mom for awhile, and she started screaming and crying. I was confused, since I loved policemen. They're helpful and strong and friendly, right? How could they make my mom cry like that?

They told me the same thing. My father was dead.

I've always wished I could remember anything about his life. I've seen pictures, and I've heard stories about what he was like from the people whose lives he touched, but that never felt like enough. I wanted to remember him in some way personal to me. I was his only child, and everyone tells me how much he loved me, even to this day. That his love could leave that much of a mark on people, but none apparent on me, was something I could never accept easily.

He had gone from his home town in Kouchi prefecture, Japan, to the United States to work at his friend's business. He was a travel agent. Not a glorious or superb position by most measures, though he certainly didn't mistake his work for his life. He was known by the community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man you would trust with your most valuable things. Still, I find it ironic that as I'm preparing to make the same journey he did now that new year's is over, from my grandparents' house back to the city I grew up in, that even as I've been successful in life by any metric, that I could never find whatever part of my soul it was that belonged to him.

Would he have been proud of his daughter? Anyone who has a father would know that the answer is yes, regardless of my material circumstances. But I never had the luxury of hearing this from him. ""Your father would be so proud of you"" stopped feeling good at some point, and began to sting.

I watched Uchouten Kazoku last year. If you're not aware, one of the main themes of the show has to do with the protagonist dealing with his father's death and legacy. Souichirou Shimogamo was a great man. He was respected by his community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man who could save the world. Yasaburou seeks to measure up to him. Yajirou hides his feelings because he lost his completeness. Yaichirou wants to have his own family. Yashirou desires a fun life.

I am these characters. All of them, all parts of me interacting on the screen, finding themselves and helping each other. I had come to terms long ago with the fact that I would never get whatever it was that I was looking for from my father. Uchouten Kazoku showed me something more valuable than that: my father wouldn't even want me to try.

Take some time to think about yourself and what your wants and needs are. 

The thing is, you *can* have it all, a relationship shouldn't hinder your ability to live your life and make choices for yourself in your early 20's. But if you're feeling like your relationship is making it hard for you to accomplish all the things you want to do, then you might need to reevaluate.

When I was 24, I walked away from the person who I thought was the love of my life. He was going through a lot and dragging me down and I thought it was ultimately what was best and healthiest for us. Picking myself and my happiness was the hardest thing I ever had to do. 2 years removed from the situation, I am in an amazing career, I'm in a great place financially and I've met someone who challenges me and makes me a better person.

113,113,3.5,"So I'm fucked off at my father still. I'm actually contemplating borderline disowning the cunt as this stage.

A few of you know a few years back I postponed my application for Pre-Medicine to head back across the country to my home town and put my palliative nursing skills to service in looking after my last remaining grandparent, my Nana because my dad was running himself into the ground trying to be full time carer for himself and my mother who lives with a disability. And his sisters (my cunt aunts and extended family did fuck all to help)

At the time my Nana's prognosis was something like 6 months and so I thought after it had all came to pass I could go back to Melbourne as re-accept my deferred application. This also stops Nana going into hospice which was something that she and everyone else didn't want at the time. Being in a small town the home nursing services are incredibly limited and not really of help.

So I move in, 4 months in, she gets a diagnosis of spontaneously remission in her secondary cancer, (she had metastatic skin cancer, and her chemo/radiation combo gave her secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma), so her prognosis for an extended life is longer in that regard other than the increasing debilitation of her skin cancer.

So the best part of 5 years drag on, my Pre-Med Acceptance is declined. I'm a 24/7 live in nurse across all aspects of care and house keep for Nana so she doesn't have to be in a home. Little time off othe than a couple of chances to get away. No energy or time for a job as well, other than reddit, there wasn't much else to keep me sane. 

One week after the funeral the cunt aunts and my dad ask me to leave the house or start paying rent (bearing in mind i was not paid other than a small government stipened for looking after Nana for ll this time, which in hospice fees alone would have been $130k a year at least).... So they can sell the place asap and get the money. I move into a friends house, buy a car and drive across the country to move here. The house sits empty for 18 months. I get no family member saying thank you for looking after her, but her friends in the community did.

Now, Nana was cremated after the funeral service and it was her wishes to be returned to her home of The Isle of Wight in the UK and be scattered there. Her ashes have been sitting at my aunts until someone goes back to the UK or they mailed her because that's what she wanted.

I get a SKYPE message at 1.50pm my time yesterday from my cunt father that reads in part ""we are going to scatter (most) of your Nan's ashes today at 2pm in the river (of my home town) so she'll be with your Grandad. A small parcel of her ashes is on it's way to the Isle of Wight""...

I get NO prior warning so that I can be there, I get nothing. I spent the better part of 5 years looking after Nana when no one else was willing to, and informing her of her rights across her medical care and ability to make informed decisions in regards to her care instead of just making her or guilting her to  do shit like her fucking kids did... and I don't even get invited to see her final farewell.

When I asked why I or my sister wasn't told sooner, I got told that I couldn't have afforded to go over there anyway... I'm thinking in my mind: You fucking CUNT you were given over $120k in inheritance, you could have flown my sister and i over and back if you wanted us there....

I'm beyond pissed and upset. I know that if the tables were turned it would have been the worlds biggest drama. 

FUCK my father and my family. Fucking histrionic narcissists.

Am I over reacting? Urgh.

I'm a fucking huge advocate for cutting any shitty family members out of your life if it'll make you happier. What's their sudden rush to scatter her ashes anyway? If your aunt has had them since the funeral, why does it have to be done *right now*? 

You did something truly wonderful in giving up your life to look after your nan, I hope you get some comfort in knowing that she probably had the best fucking care she could possibly have had, even if the shitheads she called children didn't appreciate it ♥

My nausea is subsiding with every motivational comment. Wow thanks Reddit!","Hey. You'll be okay I promise. My best advice is to embrace the tidal wave of pain as soon as possible. Don't try to not feel sad or angry or hurt or whatever. Just let yourself feel exactly how you feel.

My dad once told me you have a certain number of tears for people or things that happen and you won't be able to move on until you've cried that exact amount of tears. Once you've cried the tears, you won't be able to cry about it anymore, even if you want to, and you'll be able to move on and let go.

Cry the tears. Let both events hurt and cry about both at seperate times.

Say tonight when you get home from work or school or whatever you do during the day, at 630pm for example, cry for half an hour about your dog. Then stop at 7pm. Then cook dinner or do something else. At 830 go and cry over the break up for half an hour, then stop and do something fun. Do this every day for as long as it takes.

Do not forget the fun part though. Once you've cried, go and do something that makes you happy or feel good or generally like doing: watch a movie, have a work out, do a hobby ect. This allows you to also begin to feel normal in your life as it is now (changed). 

Don't allow yourself to wallow unless you've scheduled and end time. It will help you to not fall into depression or a depressive state.

You are awesome. Believe it. This is temporary. You will get through this.

 Solidarity and welcome to the club of twin parenthood :-)",2.7997814416885376,2.449818253517151,3.161900281906128,1.8582603335380556,2.52361261844635,2.0367136001586914,2.3904025554656982,3.564291715621948,2.928377270698548,2.875187873840332,3.0022459030151367,2.667997241020202,3.371990203857422,3.1990790367126465,2.461050271987915,2.0941638946533203,2.704695701599121,3.5878074169158936,4.02085018157959,2.843710660934448,3.771671056747437,3.93672776222229

If you don't need the money, just turn off your trading app for the next 2 years. I know it's basically impossible, but that's what it'll take for you to see your huge losses turn into huge gains, and to prevent further depression.

Also, if you're familiar with options, you can sell covered calls on your APHA position to help re-coup the losses while you wait.

I agree, about my brother. I just dont know how to put my foot down though. He shares custody of his son with his ex-wife, who lives far away, has had children with other men and separated from them as well, and seems to be struggling with a host of mental conditions and possible drug use problems. His worry (if I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is that by adding to the confusion, I might unintentionally lead the kid to some bad conclusions about the myriad of other things he experiences around his mother. I dont see it that way, but idk how to approach it with without disrespecting what he sees as a delicate situation.

She didn’t get a DUI or wreck her car and leave the scene or try to fight the Asian lady at the Chinese restaurant screaming “Speak fucking Engrish” because she couldn’t understand her, she didn’t take all of her antidepressants and barbiturates with a handle of vodka to kill herself and write DNR on her wrists and ankles, all things she’s *actually* done. 

What happened was that she felt suicidal and asked her psychiatrist for something and he gave her Klonopin, a drug she’s abused and OD’d on more than once, because she said “the walls were crawling and I wanted to die but couldn’t bring myself to kill myself and the Klonopin made it stop.” But it felt too good. She took a half a pill, then a whole, then more than one, and my sister found her last Thursday and took her to detox because she felt herself falling into bad habits. She admitted she made a mistake and never should have taken it, but that she didn’t know what else to do because she was feeling suicidal. 

She has every reason to feel that way. She had a stroke in 2013 and was denied disability. She can’t work in accounting anymore and can’t afford her house on minimum wage income so it was foreclosed on, her heat got turned off, her water got turned off, and during one of her relapses she drove drunk, wrecked her car, spent 90 days in jail and lost her license. She was living in that house miles from town for about two years, paying to have things turned on periodically when she had money, before moving in with with a friend, also a recovering addict, who relapsed a couple of weeks ago and is dealing cocaine again. I can understand why my mom feels suicidal. She’s been let go from every job she’s gotten hired to do for the last two years, most recently for falling asleep at work, and can’t find a job to pay her fines to get her car back. 

She got out of detox and had nowhere to go but her old house and she got there and found an eviction notice. It’s snowing and she has no heat or water and she told me she had to poop outside yesterday. I don’t even think she has food there. She’s been calling long-term rehab facilities to kill two birds with one stone, but what if she doesn’t get in? I know she did this all to herself but I can’t help but feel guilty that she’s all alone and cold and hungry. 

But I have my daughter. I always swore if she relapsed she would never see her again. My husband doesn’t want her in her life, and I can’t blame him. But I know this time it wasn’t bad. This time she did the wrong thing but also did the right thing by getting help. She’s trying, which is more than she’s done sometimes in the past, and I have an empty guest room and a ton of food and heat. And I don’t know what to do. I keep crying on and off when I look at my baby. How could my mom have chosen drugs over me when I was so little and needed her? I don’t want my daughter to be hurt like I was over and over and over again. But she’s my mom and she’s trying, and she’s cold and alone. And I just don’t know what to do. 

I just needed to get this out. My husband doesn’t even want to talk about it and I just feel so sad.","I am so sorry that you’re going through this. I got teary-eyed when you mentioned looking at your daughter and failing to see how your mom could abandon you.

But you love your mom deep down and the fact that your heart is open, even after countless heartaches caused by her, shows just how amazing you are. That you will even consider being vulnerable and open to pain again to someone who has hurt you time and again is so beautiful.

When I first bought him he had a white face with bright blue and red fins tipped with white. As bettas do, he changed colour a bit when I got him. He started to lose the white on his face and the black and blues became more of a drab brown. He started swimming less (no more zoomies) and his belly started to swell. The picture of him in the net was taken a week before he passed. Right after this picture was taken I quarantined him and began medication using the Marineland All-In-One tabs. He died a week later. He was extremely lethargic and breathing became very difficult for him. I wish I had ended his struggle sooner. 

His abdomen did swell up even more, but it never got as large as yours. I never overfed him, my other bettas do just fine with the same portions. He wasn't even as ravenous as the other bettas and often left 1 or 2 pellets untouched. 

I still don't know what caused it, but I miss him still. This all happened over the last 2 months.

* Your real friends will stick with you if you're honest with them about what you want to do, and why. And those who don't support you aren't your real friends. You'll figure out who is who soon enough.

I understand that I'm not to blame(fully, if at all). It's just hard not to blame myself. I was the last person to be with him and he did it a few hours later. I think I'll always have this feeling that I should have, could have done something. Then, I never took time to work through things. I went right back to work the next day like nothing happened. Worst part is it was the morning after my birthday so now every birthday, I remember the last night we got to chill.

Again, thank you for lending me your time. I never expect a stranger (or even a friend) to give me the time you just did. That is why I've hidden my depression for my entire life.","&gt; It's just hard not to blame myself. I was the last person to be with him and he did it a few hours later. I think I'll always have this feeling that I should have, could have done something.

Maybe I can offer a different perspective.  I was in your friend's shoes once, that exact timeframe, and I decided I couldn't screw over my best friend that way -- checking out without saying goodbye -- so I called him up just to say hey and had a happy conversation with him *specifically so he'd know there was nothing he could have done* to prevent it.  

Maybe I wasn't thinking straight, but the intention was to make it clear that he could not possibly have known and thus would have nothing to blame himself for.  

The decision was made, it was 100% and final, I had no doubts, there were no inner wars to fight anymore, and because that decision had been made, I was lighter and happier and more at peace than I had been in a while.  My troubles were over.  There was NO way he could have known (and he didn't, which he confirmed a couple years later when I told him what that call had really been about).  

Other things intervened, I am still here and things are a million times better now, but when you said that about your friend I had to wonder... was he possibly thinking what I was thinking then, and trying to spare you any guilt while still saying a grateful goodbye to you for your friendship by passing his last happy hours with you?  Because the possibility that he simply did not want to burden you with his despair and decision seems pretty clear to me: you can be so low that suicide is actually a big step UP, not down; good news and not bad.  That's how it was for me, and it occurs that your friend may have been experiencing it the same way.

Maybe this will help, maybe it won't, but I offer it just in case you hadn't thought about it that way before.  I'm very sorry for your loss.",1.0,1.0,282,1,"Other than this thread, I just told the first person, in my 28 years, about my depression.

It's just hard not to blame myself. I was the last person to be with him and he did it a few hours later. I think I'll always have this feeling that I should have, could have done something. Then, I never took time to work through things. I went right back to work the next day like nothing happened. Worst part is it was the morning after my birthday so now every birthday, I remember the last night we got to chill.

Again, thank you for lending me your time. I never expect a stranger (or even a friend) to give me the time you just did. That is why I've hidden my depression for my entire life.",2.7064870595932007,1.874795496463776,3.312511920928955,2.4351484775543213,3.179330348968506,1.9681726098060608,2.4203068017959595,3.404658317565918,2.102303981781006,2.730367660522461,3.016907215118408,2.260082840919494,3.763837814331055,3.418459177017212,2.3655980825424194,1.865415096282959,3.0293614864349365,3.4117236137390137,3.833312511444092,3.505300283432007,283,0,"&gt; It's just hard not to blame myself. I was the last person to be with him and he did it a few hours later. I think I'll always have this feeling that I should have, could have done something.

Maybe I can offer a different perspective.  I was in your friend's shoes once, that exact timeframe, and I decided I couldn't screw over my best friend that way -- checking out without saying goodbye -- so I called him up just to say hey and had a happy conversation with him *specifically so he'd know there was nothing he could have done* to prevent it.  

Maybe I wasn't thinking straight, but the intention was to make it clear that he could not possibly have known and thus would have nothing to blame himself for.  

The decision was made, it was 100% and final, I had no doubts, there were no inner wars to fight anymore, and because that decision had been made, I was lighter and happier and more at peace than I had been in a while.  My troubles were over.  There was NO way he could have known (and he didn't, which he confirmed a couple years later when I told him what that call had really been about).  

Other things intervened, I am still here and things are a million times better now, but when you said that about your friend I had to wonder... was he possibly thinking what I was thinking then, and trying to spare you any guilt while still saying a grateful goodbye to you for your friendship by passing his last happy hours with you?  Because the possibility that he simply did not want to burden you with his despair and decision seems pretty clear to me: you can be so low that suicide is actually a big step UP, not down; good news and not bad.  That's how it was for me, and it occurs that your friend may have been experiencing it the same way.

Maybe this will help, maybe it won't, but I offer it just in case you hadn't thought about it that way before.  I'm very sorry for your loss.",2.3914856910705566,1.8727946877479555,3.090896844863892,2.356982707977295,2.629703640937805,1.9033281207084656,2.552276015281677,3.489745616912842,2.0000849962234497,2.2456531524658203,2.9187655448913574,1.7582598328590393,3.696626663208008,3.163889169692993,2.218342065811157,1.2655856609344482,2.947111487388611,3.632380485534668,4.002957105636597,3.235045909881592,3.894861459732056,3.925752639770508

I imagine the people saying that don't understand what you're going through - maybe they never lost someone they felt so close to, but one day they might, and they will develop some perspective.

Just remember that your feelings are yours, and are not negotiable or answerable to anyone else but you. Don't let anyone draw you into defending the way you feel. If someone tries the old ""Yeah well I lost my entire family in a fire, and my dog was stolen, and my girlfriend left me. I got over it after a week, so you should too"", then you can disregard everything they say, because they are an idiot.

Grief is not a competition, and someone else's feelings do not invalidate your own. You feel what you feel, and there is no right or wrong to that.

&gt; and it's hard not to pick out all the times I could have said or done something, even if I know it wasn't those things that pushed him there.

It's OK, don't beat yourself up too badly. I still do the same - but try not to over-analyse for too long. Someone told me something that really helped me:

Even if you somehow had knowledge of what was going to happen, and if you had done everything you could have reasonably done, you may have stopped him for that day, or for that week. But the next week, or the next month, eventually he would have done it anyway. It's really not your fault.

&gt; It's hard to feel like a burden to the people I love

If you're not OK, and someone asks you, don't lie. Say so. I get that you don't want to be a burden, and sure, if you feel your colleague you speak to once a week isn't the right person to open up to, that's fine. But if someone who loves you asks if you're OK, tell them the truth. You don't need any answer or plan or know what to say next, just tell them you're not OK. If these people love you, they will want to help you. It's OK to admit when you're not OK.

Even if you just need someone to talk to for a few hours right there and then, or if you need more help, you're not going to scare away the people who really matter just because you need help - that's what family and good friends are for.

This is utterly terrible for you to go through, but you will get through it, maybe kicking and screaming at times.

Nobody had known that she was physically ill until she suddenly collapsed and had to be rushed to hospital where she was immediately submitted for emergency surgery. During surgery they discovered a tumour, which they managed to remove 50% of, however we then had to wait for test results to return to discover what type of tumour it is and what the best course to proceed with would be. 

At the time I said that I would update people on how the situation has progressed. I was naively optimistic. As of 3 hours ago I received the news via a phonecall from my mum. It’s a glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer, and in fact in the 12 days we’d been waiting for the diagnostic results to return, the tumour had already regrown the 50% that was initially removed during the first surgery. There’s no help for her. My sister is going to die, and very soon. 
She’s going in for more surgery today to try and remove as much of the tumour as possible, but at this stage it’s only so that they can buy her more time. She won’t live to see this Christmas.

It’s 04:50 in the morning here in the UK and I’m lying alone in my bed with nobody to talk to. I can't sleep. I can't do anything. I’ve never experienced anybody dying before, and up until today I’d never experienced true grief. Today I learned just how personal grief is. Everybody experiences it alone don't they? Even if you’re crying on the phone with your inconsolable mother, even though you both might be grieving for the same person, it doesn’t matter. You are both utterly alone in your grief and nothing and nobody can do anything to touch it.

Right now I keep alternating between some desperate sense of despair and denial, that maybe the surgery will discover something that will allow her to live, something overlooked, some kind of surgical cheat code – up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, only with a scalpel. I already know though. I know it. In a few weeks, maybe a month or two, if we’re lucky, my sister is no longer going to exist. My sister is going to die. 

I think I'm in shock. I don’t know what to do. My chest feels so tight, like some huge clawed hand is wrapped around me squeezing my ribcage painfully. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Do you know everybody but her knows right now? They haven’t told her the results yet, probably because they just recieved them and and because of her surgery that’s due soon. Everybody but her knows that she’s going to fucking die. Oh god she’s going to be so scared, and I can’t help her at all. I can't do anything. She’s only 30 years old for fucks sake. She has a son who she’s never going to get to see grow up. He’ll never know his mother. My mum told me on the phone, after she delivered the news, in between howls and choked sobs, that they’re going to start preparing things to set aside in the future for her son. Letters, photos, audio recordings, video recordings , so that he can at least come to know her in some way. Through aged scrawls and pixels. It’s too cruel. It’s too fucking cruel.

But you guys'll make it through. Grief's a process and there's no right or wrong way to do it or amount of time it's supposed to last or anything. Keep being supportive for the wife, be grateful for the time you guys had with the cat, and know that you had a positive impact on its life and it a positive impact on yours.

149,149,1.0,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched. I don't want people to think I'm not grateful, but 4 gildings is plenty! Please consider donating to your local Men's shelter instead. Lots of dads out there without homes or gas money to see their kids. All the love in the world. &lt;3","I'm a grown ass man and you just made me start weeping in my cubicle...this hits WAY too close to home, except with my mom

I knew from an early age she had some mental problems, but I think what I was told was exaggerated from the truth and it made me distance myself from the ""crazy"". She would text me multiple times a day, call me all the time (so much that I would often ignore her calls, and then leave me a voicemail every time I did not answer). She was what your dad feared, an over bearing parent. 

Through high school, I maybe saw her a couple times a year and she didn't live that far from me. I remember exactly when she told me she had lung and brain cancer. I was in my apartment away at college and she called me in the morning, beginning the conversation like normal, then she hit me with it. I was so scared, but for some reason the only thing I thought to say was ""Well that's what smoking packs of cigarettes a day does to you..."" I regret saying this so much. All she said was ""...I know Kyle"". 

Her remaining years, through all her Chemo and her attempt at being reborn with her local Church, I tried my best to rekindle our relationship but I never saw her as much as I should have. It was incredibly hard since I was away at college and playing baseball for my college team. 

She told me she was going to hold on to see me graduate. She was put in hospice 2 weeks before I graduated, but luckily my college was going to be streaming the graduation ceremony on TV so she would be able to watch me graduate. 3 days before I graduated, during finals week, my mom passed away in the morning. I did not get to say goodbye. 

I got a call from my sister at 4:30 AM telling me the nurses told her that it was ""time"". I was an hour or so away and just woke up, so I hopped in the shower real quick, and sped up to the hospice. When I walked up to the hospice, I was greeted by my sister and my Aunt, who immediately started crying hysterically telling me I missed her by 10 minutes. If I did not take that shower, I would have got to say goodbye to my mom. 

As much as she ""annoyed"" me being an overbearing mom, I miss those texts everyday telling me that she loved me. To this day, I don't have any room in my voicemail mailbox because they are all voicemails I never deleted from my mom and I am too scared to listen to them. 

Even after therapy, I still feel so guilty about how I treated my own mother. All she wanted was my love, and she didn't receive nearly enough and that is my biggest regret, and I will regret that until the day I die. 

I'm sorry for going on this tangent, but once I started I couldn't stop. Please, people, do not make the same mistake I made. Life is short, way to short to be standoffish with your parents. If there is any silver lining to my story, it's that it definitely helped mine and my father's relationship.",1.0,1.0,298,1,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched. I don't want people to think I'm not grateful, but 4 gildings is plenty! Please consider donating to your local Men's shelter instead. Lots of dads out there without homes or gas money to see their kids. All the love in the world. &lt;3",2.5721453428268437,1.8301923871040344,3.350933790206909,2.5946253538131714,3.2578492164611816,2.108980178833008,2.176081657409668,3.598144292831421,1.921060144901276,2.681225061416626,3.1817305088043213,1.944325029850006,3.7289748191833496,3.682110786437988,2.1245126724243164,1.9782668948173523,3.444398164749145,3.563530206680298,4.048871278762817,4.464463472366333,299,0,"I'm a grown ass man and you just made me start weeping in my cubicle...this hits WAY too close to home, except with my mom

I knew from an early age she had some mental problems, but I think what I was told was exaggerated from the truth and it made me distance myself from the ""crazy"".

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything.

Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched. I don't want people to think I'm not grateful, but 4 gildings is plenty! Please consider donating to your local Men's shelter instead. Lots of dads out there without homes or gas money to see their kids. All the love in the world. &lt;3","Something similar happened to me. My dad was a lot like how you described yours, pretty reserved and kind of distant a lot of the time, but still a good man who'd do anything for us. He was a merchant marine captain for 32 years, and worked out of Newport Oregon, so when he had the massive heart attack that took him, none of us knew right away. I never got to ask him a lot of things, but my biggest regret was not saying that I loved him before he went.

Fast forward a couple months after that and I'm at home helping my mom get his stuff together, and I found something interesting. He kept a journal, well, a diary, where he would write about my sister and I, and the things that were going on in his life. I started crying pretty much instantly, because it felt like every page was filled with things he wanted to tell us, how proud he was, how much he loved us, things he would rarely ever say in person. I always figured my dad was kind of a hardass, but in reality he kept all his emotions inside, and poured them out into that book. It felt like the guy I knew was completely different than the one in the journal.
It turns out he's always had really bad anxiety, and felt like he was never good enough for us, like we were disappointed in him all the time. I wish he could have just said something, ANYTHING, because we thought he was the coolest fucking thing since TV, and maybe the stress from holding in everything he felt could have put off his passing.
dads, tell your kids you love them.


",1.0,1.0,308,1,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me.

165,165,2.0,"My Fiance died on the 31st. Her mother is absolutely milking it and is now the talk of their small town. My Fiance hated her mother. She had done so much heinous stuff to her over the years and let other family members hurt her in ways no mother ever should. But now suddenly they were the ""best of friends"" and they ""loved each other so much."" It makes me sick just to hear about this garbage. My Fiance finally moved in with me this year after basically being a prisoner for her mother. She finally gets an escape and then when she goes back to visit a cousin on labor day weekend she's gone. All the work she put in to get away from that dinky little town of people who had given up on life and in the end it took her from me. I'll always hate that place.

In terms of the ""better place"" comments, unfortunately people just do not know how to respond when something like this happens to you. It can feel very isolating. Your SO's death becomes a significant part of who you are now, but people would rather not know because it makes them uncomfortable. They may think to themselves that they're glad it didn't happen to them, or maybe they begin to think about what if their SO suddenly goes. It's a very unnerving feeling that isn't really understood. Telling yourself they're in a better place helps one brush under the rug any discomfort they may have at such thoughts. Depending on what religion one ascribes to it may also play a role.

The kids piece hits home for me. We were to be married in spring, go on our honeymoon to Europe, and come home with a hopeful baby on the way. We had concluded that her mother would never see our child to. That's how much she hated her. My Fiance wanted nothing more than to be the first and last person I married. She worked incredibly hard to move to the city where I was, to escape her little town where dreams go to die. She had many big plans with the newfound freedom she had. And then suddenly, it was all gone.

I'm still trying to find peace so I won't tell you everything will be fine, but I empathize with your frustrations, your anger, and your feelings about what your husband would have wanted. I don't think it is conceited. I've looked over my fiance's journals that she left many times. Those pages remind me every time just how much she wanted to spend her life with me.","I'm sorry for your loss, your fiancé sounds like she had it pretty rough before meeting you, it's sad for you both that you didn't get more time together.
It's so frustrating family acting like this. I sort of wonder if it's their guilt about how badly they treated our SO's in life and now their trying to make up for it? Or perhaps they really just are narcissists (that's what hubby would say lol).
I can understand people comforting themselves with the better place thing, I just wish people would think twice about saying it to me. Maybe if hubby was sick I could understand but he wasn't. I agree people just in general have no idea what to say, maybe one day I'll write a guide ""what to say and what not to say to a grieving person"" and the main point will be ""if you don't know what to say just say ""I know there's nothing I can say to help the pain but if there's anything I can do please let me know"".
For me the loss of future kids is a big component of my grief, I can imagine it is cor you too, so this guys comment was like a knife to the gut. I told a few friends at drinks on Friday, they were so surprised I handled it as calmly as I did, they were so indignant on my behalf I thought I'd have to hold them back if they say him. I figured he just forgot hubby has passed away. Pretty nice for them I guess...

Next week my hours at work suck,but that's actually good for me because now I have to go through the process of photographing and listing all the stuff I've made, which is going to take quite a bit of work. Thankfully my boyfriend is an awesome photographer and he also runs his own online business so he's been a real help getting me started.

I recieved my [urn pendant](https://www.etsy.com/listing/521012884/925-silver-rainbow-moonstone-cremation?ref=shop_home_active_5) from DGSilver on Etsy and it's absolutely gorgeous and got here way faster than I expected. I got a citrine stone and it matches the color of my cats eyes perfectly, it's really lovely. Along with her ashes I twined two pieces of our hair together and put it in there along with a small piece of rose quartz.

Kind of crazy, but I kind of want to get a few others, they're so pretty and you can never have too many memento mori, ya know? I was thinking I'd like one of the locket style ones.

It's very comforting to have it, although I still miss my baby every single day, I'm beginning to feel like she's always with me, she left such a big impression on my heart. I'll never forget what a special bond we had.

It felt like a fairy tale when I found her, it was such a weird chance and we were so perfect for each other. It was love at first sight. I thought she'd be with me so much longer, but I'm grateful for the time we did have.

Constantly making stuff is keeping me sane, this is the most prolific I've been in years. Even though we're not together physically, I feel like she's my muse and I just want to create beautiful things,because she was so beautiful in every single way. She loved everyone,wanted to be everyone's friend, but she loved me most of all and it might sound silly, but it felt like such an honor to be loved by such an amazing creature.

The loss doesn't go away. It's bullshit when people say that. It does transform into many other things for you throughout the rest of your life though. Always beautiful.

It doesn't matter where you find friendship in life or in what way you learn the capacity for pure love. You can meet a thousand humans and never feel that way. We are lucky we had our cats.

A week later, Lorraine was diagnosed with gall bladder cancer and received a terminal diagnosis in April.

It seems strange to say it now, but aside from last year - and likely this year - being the worst of our lives it has also, in some ways, been the best.

176,176,1.0,"tw: pregnancy loss

Had a very similar situation—husband had two SA’s with low count followed by a normal one (30 million) a month later. So, we had been planning for ICSI but were then advised to try naturally for a few more months. We were one of those nauseatingly lucky couples that got pregnant the very next cycle. Unfortunately, the baby ended up having Trisomy 18, and we lost her four months into the pregnancy. This was in February. 

We’ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get pregnant again ever since. And while it hasn’t been long enough to be concerning (currently ~7dpo in cycle 5), I’m starting to feel like we’re going to need to go the ICSI route after all. Or at least, I fear that we really *do* have fertility issues and that our one-time pregnancy was just a fluke. Didn’t even result in a live birth. Anyway...once the seed has been planted that something might be wrong, it’s hard to shake. And when you’re suddenly told to try naturally again, it’s hard to go into that with confidence.

Edited to add: My husband changed nothing between his SA’s. He didn’t have any meds to stop, no alcohol to cut back on, no exercise to start, no heated underwear to stop wearing, etc. The urologist we saw said that this was completely normal variation in count. He also said that the fact that he could *ever* mount a normal count meant that he didn’t have a problem in the first place—any problem that would cause a problematically low count would make it so that he could *never* produce a normal count. He also only had 1% morphology (this was only measured on one of the SA’s for some reason—the one that had the normal count). And the urologist was *also* unconcerned about this because he thinks the criteria for morphology are overly strict and thus meaningless (e.g., why should it matter if the sperm head is 0.1 mm shorter than the criteria allow for?). This urologist is an expert in infertility (we’re fortunate to have access to lots of experts since we live in a major New England city with lots of fancy hospitals), so I guess I trust what he has to say.","Wow thanks for responding, you put into words exactly how I feel. And so sorry about your loss. I also live in the suburb of a large city and have access to great hospitals and doctors. My RE is apparently one of the best. However, there have been a couple things that I feel like are weird. For one, after my husband’s initial bad SA, he said that in his experience urologists can’t do much to improve a situation like ours so he wouldn’t recommend going. Also, my husband told him that he takes adhd medication and the doctor immediately said that wouldn’t affect it. The research I’ve done seems to say differently. Once again, just adds to the unknown.

178,178,1.5,"My mom died last August and my grief has been the heaviest weight to carry, even almost 9 months out from her death. I had reconnected with her in June of 2016 and we had attempted to build a mother-daughter relationship after 7 years of estrangement. It was a slow, but fruitful process in that an understanding and acceptance developed between us in her last months of life. We had been making plans for her to eventually meet my youngest son for the first time and two weeks later she was dead. She had been terminally sick for two years, but her death was so sudden that I wasn't able to say goodbye. Her death was very painful for her and she was alone, which breaks my heart. 

I also recognize that my grief is complicated by the fact that I'm grieving her loss for the second time - her loss to alcoholism where she lived and breathed, but she wasn't the same person I loved; she grew so hard to love (although I never stopped loving her). I think that's what really differentiates grief from loss of an alcoholic/addict and other losses. There is a two part process in mourning them while they're alive and then having to accept that all hope of them recovering is extinguished in their death, or at least that is what I have found during my grief experience.","I'm sorry to hear you lost your mom like that. From what you've said, our experiences sound similar. This kind of grief does very much feel as though it's of two natures... one aspect of it we've been going through for a long time already.

It was a slow, but fruitful process in that an understanding and acceptance developed between us in her last months of life. We had been making plans for her to eventually meet my youngest son for the first time and two weeks later she was dead. She had been terminally sick for two years, but her death was so sudden that I wasn't able to say goodbye. Her death was very painful for her and she was alone, which breaks my heart. 

I also recognize that my grief is complicated by the fact that I'm grieving her loss for the second time - her loss to alcoholism where she lived and breathed, but she wasn't the same person I loved; she grew so hard to love (although I never stopped loving her). I think that's what really differentiates grief from loss of an alcoholic/addict and other losses. There is a two part process in mourning them while they're alive and then having to accept that all hope of them recovering is extinguished in their death, or at least that is what I have found during my grief experience.",3.050654172897339,2.748942375183105,3.4048843383789062,1.5877020955085754,2.7666032314300537,2.2542556524276733,3.024531126022339,3.081697702407837,2.4942370653152466,3.274691343307495,3.065365791320801,2.495559930801392,3.328176975250244,3.5498387813568115,2.8710345029830933,2.414780378341675,2.495414614677429,3.460966825485229,4.329140663146973,3.906670093536377,357,0,"I'm sorry to hear you lost your mom like that.

1. Had lunch with a man and his online pictures didn’t do him justice, in person his shin was gray and his teeth were atrocious- not clean. I shouldn’t have gotten in his car... He gushed about ‘me being so awesome’, it was nauseating. After the lunch date I said ‘no thanks’. He still tried to kiss me and touch me. Then he would not stop messaging me. Not kidding 40 text messages and then he called me repeatedly. It’s when ‘No doesn’t mean NO’. 
2. Went for lunch in the park with a ‘older’ man, it was okay. He lied about his height. He said that he would drive me back to work, so I got in his truck and he lunged at me to kiss me and he actually grabbed my breasts. Lesson learned, do not get into cars with men who I don’t know very well. 
I have more examples. There are too many creepy men and women on dating sites, and my trust level and expectations are zero now.  I would much rather get to know someone at a slower pace.

There are absolutely too many men out there who have no idea how to socially interact, and do awful and cringey shit like this.

It's actually the worst, and you have my sympathies that you've had to deal with it firsthand.

And, while I don't want to mitigate the difficulties you've had, I would offer that there's likely a reason that so many men want to meet up right away -- you've stated it yourself: so many people aren't who they say they are on the internet, and people (men, in particular), want to know and see who they're talking to -- physical compatibility is important if you want to be in a relationship, and important for determining whether or not you want to begin one (this is important for friendships too -- whether you want to be friends with someone determines tone, and that's partially dictated by physical appearance). Similarly, interpersonal chemistry is important, and an online chat room can't simulate that.

Generally, though, in-person, the same way our grandparents did it, is the way to go for the vast majority of people in this day and age still; dating sites only work for a very small minority of people.",2.0,1.0,366,1,"Well, where to start.

There are absolutely too many men out there who have no idea how to socially interact, and do awful and cringey shit like this.

It's actually the worst, and you have my sympathies that you've had to deal with it firsthand.

And, while I don't want to mitigate the difficulties you've had, I would offer that there's likely a reason that so many men want to meet up right away -- you've stated it yourself: so many people aren't who they say they are on the internet, and people (men, in particular), want to know and see who they're talking to -- physical compatibility is important if you want to be in a relationship, and important for determining whether or not you want to begin one (this is important for friendships too -- whether you want to be friends with someone determines tone, and that's partially dictated by physical appearance). Similarly, interpersonal chemistry is important, and an online chat room can't simulate that.

Generally, though, in-person, the same way our grandparents did it, is the way to go for the vast majority of people in this day and age still; dating sites only work for a very small minority of people.",2.6040472984313965,1.524154007434845,3.0677733421325684,2.5072178840637207,3.191903591156006,1.9993966221809387,2.6616629362106323,3.194282531738281,1.5460030436515808,2.4057635068893437,3.017007827758789,1.8348974585533144,3.817005395889282,3.375152111053467,2.15798819065094,1.227001890540123,3.2200257778167725,3.648470878601074,3.927371025085449,3.9721834659576416,3.9124538898468018,3.69861364364624

- get into a body weight routine you can do beside the cot, I started a 100 press up challenge that I did whenever I was on ‘duty’
- try and keep a sense of humour in the house, we used to flip a coin for who was going to change nappies, little things like that made it easier

Thank God for my husband, we are leaning on and supporting each other and I know somehow we will make it through this together.",2.522595286369324,2.151562213897705,3.3405117988586426,2.239039778709412,3.169624328613281,2.2356953620910645,1.999912142753601,3.558490753173828,1.893183171749115,2.6262686252593994,2.9876068830490112,2.2836755514144897,3.62767505645752,3.452395439147949,1.954468309879303,2.2560269832611084,2.97912061214447,3.52386474609375,3.8426125049591056,3.8644165992736816,377,0,"Oh my dear, I am so very, very sorry. This is not remotely your fault. This is life being terrible, and nothing more. You love your babies and did everything a mother could possibly do for them. There is just so little to be done sometimes. My friend lost her baby at 24 weeks, in almost the same situation. She did everything right. Everything. It just happened anyway, and we may never know why. It is brutally unfair that this happens to wonderful parents and my heart breaks for you, too.

189,189,1.5,"I never thought last weekend would be my last with her.  She had just turned 10 on Tuesday the 5th.  She wasn’t showing signs of major decline besides taking her time climbing the stairs.  On Thursday, she threw up her dinner, and layed on the floor and refused to move for a while.  She had done that before, as she absolutely gulped down her food, so my wife and I didn’t think anything of it.  I did carry her up the stairs to bed that night as she didn’t want to come up.

She was absolutely fine the next day, her usual appetite and energy.  I made sure to lay down on the floor with her every morning and before I went to bed every night, nuzzled my head in her neck to tell her how much I loved her, and what a good girl she was.  I was relieved to see her back to normal.  We had friends over later that night, one of whom is 6’7 who she would just stand in front of and bark at excitedly; however that night I noticed she didn’t.  

Saturday I was out all day with my kids, I made sure to give her a pat before I left.  She didn’t seem to have her usual appetite as my kids left crumbs all over the floor from their breakfast, which she usually vacuums up excitedly, that morning she just layed there on her bed.  When I came back later that day my wife mentioned that there was something wrong with Stella.  When my wife called her to come in, she found her lying underneath the chaise lounge breathing heavily, not moving.  My wife had to carry her in the house, and tried to pull her up onto her four legs.  When she did, Stella just slumped to the floor.  Thinking she may just need water we gave her some, which she eventually drank.  I sat with her on the floor and patted her head until her breathing normalized, and then we left the house.  I’m not sure if I said bye to her when I left. 

We were gone for a few hours, and when we came back to the house she had passed away in front of the kitchen sink.  We ushered our kids up the stairs quickly before they could see her.  They knew something was wrong as my wife was sobbing, and I was in shock.  I carried her body out of the house and lay her on the grass in a dark area do that my kids could say a final goodbye to our girl.  It was one of the hardest things I have ever done as a parent, telling my boys that Stella passed away.  

Our family is still devastated, she was an amazing part of our family, and it is really difficult to accept that she is gone, but Talking about it helps me get through each day.

Update- thank you so much for your support.  It has helped me immensely.  Now instead of searching for answers as to why this happened, asking whether or not we could have done something different to prevent this, I can focus on remembering the good times, laughter, and great memories she brought to our lives.  Thank you again.","Very sorry for your loss. 10 wonderful years and forever she will wag in your heart.

My older pup is nearing 10 and I thought we were going to lose him 2 weeks ago. MRI revealed bad infection escalated to meningitis. A brutal experience waiting 13 hours in hospital to get MRI. I couldn't sleep and cried on and off all night. I am a 35 year old man and don't cry often.  

Doctor began treating infection and inflammation aggressively and he's just about back to normal self. Had a check up earlier and even doctor is almost stunned by progress. He's a resilient old man.

I treat every day with him as a gift but often drift ahead in my mind to painful reality you are now experiencing. Having endured the pain of expected loss once, I wonder if it will hurt less. We are lucky to have this extra time to treasure him. 

Sending a virtual hug your way and hope time will heal and you can laugh about all the fun, goofy, special times.",1.0,2.0,378,1,"I never thought last weekend would be my last with her.

I had injured my elbow about 4 years ago. I had pulled my ulnar nerve out from between the crevasse of bone in my inner elbow. That took over two years to fully heal enough for me to do upper body again. I finally started benching again and over did it because I was too excited. ended up getting shoulder tendonitis that hasnt healed for over a year. Then right after that someone pushed down on my hip when i was laying down and pulled my lower back which prevented me from squatting and deadlifting. Over all I've been out for about three years over the course of five years on different body parts. My back was definitely the worst seeing as I couldnt deadlift or squat. I'm so happyto be back but it's still hurting me occasionally. I'm afraid I'll just live with these injuries pestering me forever honestly, but at least i'm able to do more things than I was.


depending on what you have, I might be able to give you some pointers to help? Rock climbing has deifnitely helped build my shoulder muscle back up and I'm able to low bar squat again. For my lower back I did a lot of different exercises and stretches, and for my elbow I had to do like 2 years of PT so I have a lot of things for that lol.

As for my husband, after much medical testing, we don't have many answers.  He doesn't have a brain tumor.  His neurologist was sure he had M.S. because he has all the symptoms, except he doesn't have lesions that would show up on an MRI.  

Our insurance pretty much denied further testing, so his neuro settled on fibromyalgia with chronic migraines, which is sort of a b.s. result in my opinion.

His doctor tried to do a follow up MRI, and our insurance hassled us in paying it, and made it such a pain that I think they intentionally did it as a warning to not submit to further testing.  It sucks because I used to have really fantastic insurance 7-8 years ago, but even though we're with the same company, they deny everything, and make us submit appeal after appeal.

I'm concidering trying therapy and seeing if it'll help. I'm not sure what else. I'm already eating healthy and working out (in our garage with weights as I feel too anxious at the gym) I feel it is GOOD for me of course but I more battle with my mind, I feel good physically but mentally it's just horrible.

201,201,3.0,"Story since I do need to vent: Her and I had dated despite her circumstances. To not go in all of the detail in the world, she was Jehova's Witness but couldn't find a way out of the religion because rightfully so she loved her family. We worked and talked about this extensively but given her age and reliance on her family, she wasn't able to readily leave. Which was fine. Over time, other aspects of abuse from her parents surfaced and I tried my best to help her with the little bit I knew. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much because her reaction to any form of confrontation regardless of how light was to get immediately defensive and an imminent complete shut down. This made talking about our problems a prolonged and impossible ordeal. 

Over time I found it difficult to talk to her because of these things. We grew fairly distant and a lot of the things we enjoyed doing together disappeared slowly. Either she would blow me off for streaming her game or I would be busy doing other things to unwind. Even so, we would fall asleep together every night, talk, spend time together. Try our best.

We got into a huge argument one night in which she was angry I'd stopped trying to open up to her or talk to her about problems and I got immensely frustrated and told her that it was because she was impossible to talk to. I did not know how to talk to her. She would shut down. She doesn't do anything to overcome this despite how long we've tried. 

I've had to date this woman in secret, while she lied to her parents, friends, and everything essentially became virtual. There are times she would have to delete photos of us and I stored them on USB's or resend them. When I'd visit her (she lived a few hours away), she would refuse to help with any of the expenses despite having a  decent job. Especially after I was let go from my previous job because it went under. Not visiting resulted in an understanding but her crying and the pain she felt would swallow me so i'd sacrifice to do so. 

Though she would stay up to wait for me, she never bother reciprocating anything. While I was making a very moderate living and spending wasn't an issue at the time, the first sign of trouble and explaining to her why I felt I couldn't talk to her was the end result of her emasculating me. While I understood that this was her inability to comprehend my issues because her parents are well off and she's well taken care of, it hurt me that this disconnect due to our inability to communicate or me finding a way for us to comfortably talk resulted in this. I put so much of the weight and blame on myself as a slightly older person and more experienced person but I realized painfully slow that this wasn't something I could handle anymore. I tried desperately to find ways and hid my problems in light of me finding a new job (second shift / 70k -- 40k pay cut after incentives and bonuses are factored in) while having to take care of a mentally challenged mother and assist my grandparents as my grandmother begins to lose her life. In this plight I lost one of my brothers very young to a horrible accident and I felt as if I was under water for over a year. 

So painfully so, we broke up. 

We were fine for a while but she started challenging me about things during the break up. I had ordered her a very cheap necklace with what I presumed was enough Amazon Credit but I didn't have enough and I had to swap cards. I didn't check this until after the holidays and reordered on Saturday morning. She threw a fit about this. After I showed her the evidence on the matter, she began telling me she was angry at me and we shouldn't talk for the night. I said if we don't find a way to talk now then we wont ever. She challenged me more and I snapped, asked when was the last time she offered to do things for me. That there's givers and there are takers and she's just the latter. Why do I have to feel as if the burden of all this nonsense is on me? When has she apologized for being wrong? Or tried to help me?

Mid way, she laughed and hung up.

So I walked away. I deleted and blocked everything. 

It's been a while but I'm still overwhelmed by it and it's eating me up. I blame myself for so much and I feel stupid because I have seen these red flags and I ignored them because I was obsessed with the idea of not losing a relationship regardless of the context.

So I haven't been able to sleep and here I am, brothers. I needed to vent. Thanks for reading. 

Edit: I'm sure she has her perspective and it's equally painful. I don't deny it. I think about it a lot but this is how I felt and I could never talk to her or tell her these things. We never got the chance to really sift through it after all.

Edit 2: For anyone who is confused, my ex and I would obviously fall asleep on the phone together. I just wanted to clarify this. 

Also, I've scheduled a few appointments this week with a friend to speak with therapists on my personal matters. Thank you all for being there for me. I appreciate all of you.","I'm so, so sorry, that sounds incredibly difficult. 

While it was your job to be supportive and there for your ex, it was never your job to fix her, and she needs to fix herself before she can be a good partner to someone in a relationship. 

What you're doing now, taking an inventory and looking back, is healthy. Eventually you'll get to closure, but before then there's a lot to process, contextualize, and come to understand with the benefit of a more objective eye. Give yourself permission to feel all of it, to think on your feelings. And, as is always classic, take the opportunity to work on yourself. After a breakup, I usually reorganize my life in the process of separation. I clean up things, streamline and recommit to my goals (physical, social, and mental health being biguns), organize my schedule, etc. 

You didn't deserve any of that and by all accounts were a really loyal and devoted partner. Do that for yourself now, reaffirm that you deserve to be treated with love and respect.

While it was your job to be supportive and there for your ex, it was never your job to fix her, and she needs to fix herself before she can be a good partner to someone in a relationship. 

What you're doing now, taking an inventory and looking back, is healthy. Eventually you'll get to closure, but before then there's a lot to process, contextualize, and come to understand with the benefit of a more objective eye. Give yourself permission to feel all of it, to think on your feelings. And, as is always classic, take the opportunity to work on yourself. After a breakup, I usually reorganize my life in the process of separation. I clean up things, streamline and recommit to my goals (physical, social, and mental health being biguns), organize my schedule, etc. 

You didn't deserve any of that and by all accounts were a really loyal and devoted partner. Do that for yourself now, reaffirm that you deserve to be treated with love and respect.

She was apparently not done with me, so with all her failing might tried to walk inside with me. It was so sad I picked her up and sat on the couch with her for  half hour.

217,217,1.0,"I'm the woman that is being talked about in that chat log. I am not Jane Doe from the google doc....that's another person that he did this to, I know her and she didn't come forward for the same reason I didn't. We were, and still are, absolutely terrified of backlash. I understand that without more information, you can't prove that I'm just a nobody making shit up, but I'm not. I was told about this as early as last night, and after 5 years of being forced into silence, I cannot tell you how I'm feeling. People know now, they actually believe us now. The people I told about this, the very few, they knew I would not and could not lie about something like this. Because jane Doe did try to speak about it before, she told a fan site, she was then called a troll and ""that's like accusing a puppy of murder"". Because of that, and this is way before what he did to me, I knew I could never ever say anything without getting fucking crucified by these fucking psycho fans. He did a really good job of being the person to look up to and to trust, which is why no one would ever believe this. He took advantage of me when I was at the lowest point of my life, he knew exactly what he was doing. It was calculated. Then, he shot himself, and I (and the others) knew we could never ever talk about this, because he's not here anymore, and his widow could even sue us if she wanted. He has an elderly mother, and the thought of her knowing what happened made my heart break, so I kept silent. I talked to therapy for years, I still every now and again have nightmares of him and his face, and that horrific feeling of what he did to me, what he did to my body. I had to blacklist anything related to him on my twitter. Seeing his photo makes me sick. I hate that he killed himself, even with all of this, I never ever would be okay with that, it's a terrible thing that happened, and I wish he never did that, but I cannot be okay with the sexual assault that happened to me when I repeatedly said NO, and he waited until I passed out.

I just want you all to know that we were forced into silence for 5 years, because of this fucking crazy fans of CA who refuse to believe anything bad about them, including some of their own producers. I reached out to one of the women who released this google doc to anonymously say something about this, and I was ignored. She knew about it and did nothing.

I am not Jane Doe from the google doc....that's another person that he did this to, I know her and she didn't come forward for the same reason I didn't. We were, and still are, absolutely terrified of backlash. I understand that without more information, you can't prove that I'm just a nobody making shit up, but I'm not. I was told about this as early as last night, and after 5 years of being forced into silence, I cannot tell you how I'm feeling. People know now, they actually believe us now. The people I told about this, the very few, they knew I would not and could not lie about something like this. Because jane Doe did try to speak about it before, she told a fan site, she was then called a troll and ""that's like accusing a puppy of murder"". Because of that, and this is way before what he did to me, I knew I could never ever say anything without getting fucking crucified by these fucking psycho fans. He did a really good job of being the person to look up to and to trust, which is why no one would ever believe this. He took advantage of me when I was at the lowest point of my life, he knew exactly what he was doing. It was calculated. Then, he shot himself, and I (and the others) knew we could never ever talk about this, because he's not here anymore, and his widow could even sue us if she wanted. He has an elderly mother, and the thought of her knowing what happened made my heart break, so I kept silent. I talked to therapy for years, I still every now and again have nightmares of him and his face, and that horrific feeling of what he did to me, what he did to my body. I had to blacklist anything related to him on my twitter. Seeing his photo makes me sick. I hate that he killed himself, even with all of this, I never ever would be okay with that, it's a terrible thing that happened, and I wish he never did that, but I cannot be okay with the sexual assault that happened to me when I repeatedly said NO, and he waited until I passed out.

222,222,1.5,"My only knowledge on this topic is from my family's experience-- Narcan was not available to family members when my cousin died. Not that it would have helped much-- he had supposedly been clean for 6 months and no one knew he was using, and his girlfriend abandoned him when he OD'd and he wasnt found for 12 hours. She's a horrible human being, but thats a story for another day. I know it is now available for purchase for the general public but I don't believe its free in my midwest hometown, not yet at least. 

I live in the coastal south now and thankfully the heroin epidemic isn't anywhere near as bad here. I got out of my hometown because its depressing to go home, 90% of everyone I know back home is dead, still on heroin, or in some kind of recovery. Heroin used to be so uncommon, and only the hardest of drug addicts used it, now everyone and their mother and brother is hooked on it. Its awful.","I am so so soo sorry for your loss. I know the pain of losing loved ones due to addiction. Honestly, it sounds like your cousin was clean for the time you thought he/she was. And only relapsed to use 1 time and they didn't make it. Most of my friends that have ODed, were in the same situation as your cousin. People don't realize how drasticly their tolerance drops during their clean time. And all it takes is that first relapse, that ends up being too strong for them😓That is terrible that his gf left him when he really needed help. That is why many states have The Good Samaritan law in place. It gives the 911 caller (and I think the person ODing)  immunity from getting arrested, even if more drugs were found on the scene. But everyone should look up that law because it varys by state. 

Also, narcan should be easier to get. In some states its very easy, over the counter and free. In other states, its much more difficult to get. And you might need a prescripton for it, which also costs about $150 per dose.  

But I totally agree with you. All kinds of people have opiate habits. In rehab, I've met cops, soccer moms, doctors, lawyers, teachers, grandparents, teenagers, rich and poor, and all different ages and races. Addiction does not discriminate. It's crazy too because there are a lot of functioning addicts. That wear suits and drive fancy cars. You wouldnt even be able to pick some addicts out in a giant crowd. It's sad how many people have addiction problems these days. And it's insane how many people have passed away. Super young too and way before they were supposed too.  And theres drugs everywhere.  More in some places than others. But I'm happy for you that you moved to a place, that has less heroin around.

I know the pain of losing loved ones due to addiction. Honestly, it sounds like your cousin was clean for the time you thought he/she was. And only relapsed to use 1 time and they didn't make it. Most of my friends that have ODed, were in the same situation as your cousin. People don't realize how drasticly their tolerance drops during their clean time. And all it takes is that first relapse, that ends up being too strong for them😓That is terrible that his gf left him when he really needed help. That is why many states have The Good Samaritan law in place. It gives the 911 caller (and I think the person ODing)  immunity from getting arrested, even if more drugs were found on the scene. But everyone should look up that law because it varys by state. 

Also, narcan should be easier to get. In some states its very easy, over the counter and free. In other states, its much more difficult to get. And you might need a prescripton for it, which also costs about $150 per dose.  

But I totally agree with you. All kinds of people have opiate habits. In rehab, I've met cops, soccer moms, doctors, lawyers, teachers, grandparents, teenagers, rich and poor, and all different ages and races. Addiction does not discriminate. It's crazy too because there are a lot of functioning addicts. That wear suits and drive fancy cars. You wouldnt even be able to pick some addicts out in a giant crowd. It's sad how many people have addiction problems these days. And it's insane how many people have passed away. Super young too and way before they were supposed too.  And theres drugs everywhere.  More in some places than others. But I'm happy for you that you moved to a place, that has less heroin around. It's probably a safer area in general because of that, with less crimes being commited.",2.4822150468826294,1.5498623847961426,2.856771230697632,2.605054378509521,3.208221673965454,1.9543418288230896,2.698994994163513,3.140052318572998,1.6234885454177856,2.7696216106414795,3.1195921897888184,2.02126693725586,4.040545225143433,2.7007185220718384,2.0958539247512817,1.938209056854248,3.390974283218384,3.9360647201538086,3.628817558288574,4.053388833999634,3.9498891830444336,3.861506700515747

I just want to be able to speak freely without feeling like somebody is physically pulling at my vocal chords. I can't even raise my voice without it hurting. It feels very wrong, weird, and I can't stop feeling ugly inside. If only I wasn't so stubborn and useless, I could have stopped a month ago, just when the negative thoughts started to pile up on me, but I didn't, and this is something I'm going to have to carry on my back for the rest of my days...

For some stupid reason I kept on trying to convince myself that the longer I stay on T, the more ""used to it"" I would become, and the less awkward I would feel about the changes. I really didn't want to be wrong. I spent so long mulling this over, I just didn't want to face the fact that I was wrong, because being wrong meant I was deceiving everyone, and I never wanted to make out that I was lying. Yet here I am, finally admitting to myself that being on testosterone was a mistake... that I shouldn't have done it... and it hurts...

I know I shouldn't be this upset, things could have been much worse, I should be thankful that it was only 3 months, but I just can't handle the fact that it was me who put me into this situation in the first place... nobody else told me to go on hormones... this was my own choice....

I'm really really sorry for pouring my heart out like this. I don't even know what you may be going through right now, you've been on T for much longer than I have, and here's me rambling on about my damn issues! I just keep feeling really disconnected from the world right now, there's just nobody available to share this with, the people out there who've been with me throughout this entire transition, I don't even know what they're going to think of me anymore... I'm nothing but a delusional freak. 

As silly as this sounds, I've even be driving myself crazy with the thought of putting myself back on testosterone just so my voice can break and the knotted feeling in my throat can end. I know this means I'll only end up hurting myself further, but if my voice breaks at least I could try and speak in a softer voice instead of being stuck with this permanent monotonous voice... I know I'll sound like a man, but maybe if I tried voice training to get it to sound more feminine, maybe I could handle this if it means I won't be having any more sore throats... 

The sore throats ended up starting a while back, they're a little worse now, I'm scared of it remaining like this... 

&amp;#x200B;","Hey, it’s okay. This is a really, really stressful thing to go through. I was in the same, overwhelmed position as you just a little over a month ago. You feel ugly and like there’s no way you can go back to living a normal life, I know. But the good thing is that you can. 

It’s really hard to admit when you’re wrong. And it’s even harder to accept when you’ve made a mistake and hurt yourself, and you have no one to blame but your own poor decision making. It’s really hard to go through, and you should take some time for yourself. But first of all; forgive yourself. You’re not ugly. I know how disgusting you can feel sometimes, being a cis girl who has had male hormones in her body and having to deal with all the manly after effects. It’s really hard especially because girls are so ridiculed and told they’re worthless if they have deep voices or body hair or aren’t good at being feminine. Those reasons are part of why I even started HRT in the first place. 

But you’re not ugly. You’re beautiful. No matter how you look, you are. I know it’s hard to really believe and feel, I struggle to feel like I am too. But I promise you that this gets better. I don’t know what your favorite things to do are, but do whatever you know will bring you happiness for a while. I myself just OVERCOMPENSATED, so hardcore for a while to feel more “worthy” of being female, because I didn’t at first at all. I did some pretty dumb shit, like waxed all my body hair off, plucked my facial hair out (all over my chin and shit, augh), started wearing heavy makeup every day, went on birth control,bought a push up bra and lots of panties.... of course, this is certainly not everyone’s cup of tea at all, but I just did everything I could to make myself feel like a “normal girl” because I just didn’t feel like one or like I was good enough to be one at all. But in just one month, I’m already so much happier. I really promise you’ll be okay.

Try treating your cracking voice as a sore throat or cold! Drink lots of hot tea with lemon and honey. Do salt water gargles. Drink lots of water, and try to rest your voice. You honestly may also have just caught a cold or something, it is starting to get colder and all. And even if you didn’t, being kind to your voice may help it relax. 

Anyway, best of luck. Feel free to talk to me at all if you need support, I know how scary this all is.

Make a decision, and start taking action on it without looking back.

It's a pretty big, significant decision, and clearly you're aware of this, and what you need to do to act on your chosen decision.  

YOLO, bro. You one get one, and it's yours.  So put your life first in your life.  

Take care of yourself, bro, and make sure you're happy and lead a happy life.

I'm sorry to hear about your troubles, but improving your body is one way to improve your self-esteem. I was about 180 when i graduated high school, played sports, thought about playing in college, but decided to do the party thing. I lifted almost everyday, but i was drinking, smoking, and eating a shit ton. By the time i graduated i was about 235. first job out of college, i absolutely hated. My mom died, I hated my work, I quit lifting, and basically just turned in on myself. I quit that job, moved, and decided i needed to stop feeling bad for myself and start getting my shit together. I dropped from 235 to 165 and feel a lot better. I'm back to playing soccer usually a few times a week and running when i don't. Just realized that i'm much happier when i can look at myself and be like, ok well now you just need to work on getting your other shit together, now that you're not about to have a heart attack.

No second places there. Dead last in every race. The world would be better without me but my two failed suicide attempts have steered me clear of proactive solutions. I guess my experience could benefit someone else. Don't be a fuckup, kids.","Okay, I am not a professional.  I am only a guy who values logic and critical thinking in all aspects of life.  But here are my recommendations:

1) Go see a professional.  They can really help you put things in perspective, and conquer them,

2) Look at each event and tell yourself, as honestly as possible, why they happened.  Whether it was your fault, someone else’s fault, or a freak accident few could have predicted.  Find the cause for each incident.

3) Decide what YOU would or could do differently now (no matter who or what caused the situation).  

Understand that there are infinite variations we can make in EVERY choice that can change the outcome.  No choice is ever only one way or the other, and nothing else.  There are infinite variables around the choice that you can manipulate.

Don’t settle for a solution you don’t like, but don’t force a solution the other parties involved wouldn’t like either.  Find one of the infinite variations that could work for everyone.

4) I was suicidal once, and thought of myself as a total failure.  So I can tell you what helped me.

I was watching Conan the Barbarian (Arnold Swartzenneger, James Earl Jones), and in it, James Earl Jones is the big bad guy who enthrals people to be his slaves.  He commands one slave to jump to her death onto a wooden platform far below.  She dies, and breaks through the platform.  James Earl Jones says, “That is the power of a human life.” (Or something like that).

I realized right there that whether I value myself or not, just being a human with the ability to manipulate things, to learn, to change myself and my surroundings, is VERY powerful.  Sure, everyone can do it, but we forget how amazing it is.

So I decided if I was going to kill myself, I would die doing something I believed in.  If I wanted to help the poor, I would pour my all into helping the poor.  If I wanted to become a ninja, I would pour my all into becoming a ninja.  If I was ready to die anyway, it wouldn’t matter.  So I could do anything.

There’s a Reddit post around here with the same idea:  Suicidal people should go do something amazing, so they either go out being awesome, or go out helping people.  And maybe, on the way, they learn to value themselves, and/or life.  But it doesn’t have to be that extreme.

5) You are valuable, so take some time to list what you can do that is valuable, and what you believe in that you could put your efforts into.  And don’t give up if things go slowly, or change doesn’t happen as fast as you’d like at whatever you choose to do.

242,242,2.0,"Yesterday ended in a pretty stressful way, so I'm up early trying to stop agonizing about it so that I can *try* to go back to sleep.  I'm a fairly anxious person and a *sort-of* reformed people-pleaser. In the past I've bent over backwards for people to the detriment of my own health, so it's something I try really hard to avoid.  This past year I've had a childhood friend resurface, who has just gone through an ugly divorce, and is living with her grandmother and recovering addict sister.  She has very little money and is trying to find a job, while her family expects her to take care of everyone she's living with.  While I love her and want to be a supportive friend, she's been incredibly demanding, often calling me late at night or when I'm at work.  I've tried to maintain boundaries by not picking up the phone or replying to every text, while letting her know that I do love and support her.  Yesterday things came to a head when I gently tried to let her know that once I got home I would be putting my phone away so I could focus on my husband, but that she should send me an email of everything she wanted to say so I could reply to it in the morning.  She did not react well.  She accused me of being dishonest about how I felt about her, and said that texting and emails were incredibly unhelpful and wasn't this supposed to be about her?  Then when I tried to point out that I couldn't support her in the way that she wanted due to my commitments and needs, she laid on the guilt, kept apologizing for being annoying and said she'd stop bothering me from that point on.

I tried not to let it destroy my night, but it really hurt.  I totally recognize that she is being manipulative because she doesn't want boundaries, but it still hurts me because I want to be a supportive friend and she's been dealing with a truly horrible situation.  I'm still upset about it this morning and part of me doesn't want to deal with it anymore, which doesn't make me feel better about myself.  On top of that my cat did not seem well last night, which led to me crying hysterically in my husband's arms.  After a bit she came down and snuggled with me, which made me feel better, but I'm pretty emotionally burnt out this morning. 

I need to figure out something to do with myself today as a distraction.  I might text my friend that I need a break for a day or two.  Between my cat's illness, this looming beta test, and the progesterone, I just don't have the emotional bandwidth right now.","Oh love, that sounds draining! Does your friend know what is going on with you? Even if she doesn't, she really needs to respect your boundaries and realise that you are setting them because you need to. I have the same urge to help people so understand entirely where you are coming from! I hope that your friend was just having a bad day, and that she apologises for upsetting you.  It's fair enough that she is going through a rough time, but if she knows you and how you like to look after people then I hope she can understand your position. In the meantime, look after yourself lovely. I hope your cat is OK ☺️",1.0,3.0,484,1,"Yesterday ended in a pretty stressful way, so I'm up early trying to stop agonizing about it so that I can *try* to go back to sleep.

This past year I've had a childhood friend resurface, who has just gone through an ugly divorce, and is living with her grandmother and recovering addict sister.  She has very little money and is trying to find a job, while her family expects her to take care of everyone she's living with.  While I love her and want to be a supportive friend, she's been incredibly demanding, often calling me late at night or when I'm at work.  I've tried to maintain boundaries by not picking up the phone or replying to every text, while letting her know that I do love and support her.  Yesterday things came to a head when I gently tried to let her know that once I got home I would be putting my phone away so I could focus on my husband, but that she should send me an email of everything she wanted to say so I could reply to it in the morning.  She did not react well.  She accused me of being dishonest about how I felt about her, and said that texting and emails were incredibly unhelpful and wasn't this supposed to be about her?  Then when I tried to point out that I couldn't support her in the way that she wanted due to my commitments and needs, she laid on the guilt, kept apologizing for being annoying and said she'd stop bothering me from that point on.

I tried not to let it destroy my night, but it really hurt.  I totally recognize that she is being manipulative because she doesn't want boundaries, but it still hurts me because I want to be a supportive friend and she's been dealing with a truly horrible situation.  I'm still upset about it this morning and part of me doesn't want to deal with it anymore, which doesn't make me feel better about myself.  On top of that my cat did not seem well last night, which led to me crying hysterically in my husband's arms.  After a bit she came down and snuggled with me, which made me feel better, but I'm pretty emotionally burnt out this morning. 

I need to figure out something to do with myself today as a distraction.  I might text my friend that I need a break for a day or two.  Between my cat's illness, this looming beta test, and the progesterone, I just don't have the emotional bandwidth right now.",2.4493731260299683,1.7761918306350708,2.725145697593689,2.403533697128296,3.155797004699707,2.049649715423584,2.574105739593506,2.6773844957351685,1.560420572757721,2.351181507110596,3.235399007797241,2.1343727111816406,3.3966031074523926,2.780834913253784,2.062105774879456,1.2024428397417068,2.973185896873474,3.646064043045044,3.7877142429351807,3.438720941543579,485,0,"Oh love, that sounds draining!

It’s totally already to be sad about it. You can feel completely crushed, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

256,256,1.0,"I guess it's time for me to make an actual post after lurking here for 3 years. I'm a 30 year old Air Force vet. I was Security Forces in the AF (basically military police) and served one tour in Iraq where I was injured during an attack. I'd rather avoid the details of the attack but the injuries are to my wrist and lower back, it's chronic debilitating pain. On top of that I have pretty severe PTSD to the point where I can't play most of the cool new video games with my friends that I am really interested in (Battlefield 1, PUBG, even Overwatch is difficult).  
All of this has completely screwed my chances of being employed. I get a pension from the VA but it's exactly enough to keep the roof over my head and afford groceries. That's mostly fine because the PTSD doesn't really work well with clubing and night life/social life. 
The VA's answer is to load me up on SSRIs and Oxy, it's disgusting the amount of Oxy I have in my medicine cabinet. I did that stuff for awhile, like a lot of it for a long while to where the days started to blend together and I was basically a drugged up vessel devoid of feeling and emotion. I had to give it up and an old friend helped me by introducing me to kratom.  
It's been nearly two years and I haven't touched oxy or the prozac because I just haven't felt the need for it. Kratom does everything those medications do and more. I've managed to get out to friends places for board game nights and socializing, I'm a lot happier, I get a consistent night sleep, I find enjoyment in holidays. I just feel like a human again.  
However, it's hard for me to order kratom because my budget is so tight, what little amount I can order is usually the Gaia sampler pack and that runs out quick! Most of you may think that's a lot of kratom and it should last me a month, I get that, but it doesn't. I can't even begin to tell you how awful my pain is, I dose a lot because I **have** to. There have been days where I have to call my sister to come help me out of bed because my back is so tightly locked up. Just typing that last sentence and reading it to myself makes me tear up. I'm fucking 30 man! This pain, this struggle is for life.  
Anyway, it feels foreign for me to share my problems on the internet but this sub seems genuinely welcoming so there's my little piece of it.

Death is a grim subject, and your outlook will probably be pretty grim for a good while because you've had death in your life very recently. Allow yourself time to grieve, and don't give a shit about anyone who thinks you're being melodramatic. 

Those people are the sheltered little cunts that have never had lost anyone they really cared about, and they're talking out of their ass because they don't have the experience to recognize what's actually going on with your feelings.

Don't pay attention to that kind of criticism and give yourself time to grieve. It'll get better.

then homelife is kinda shit, both my parents have alcohol problems (my dad much moreso than my mum), and my dad tends to be an asshole a lot of the time, when he's sober he's actually pretty good, but that's like 30% of the time. and this once again might be me being melodramatic, but as much as i recognize that my parents love each other, i can tell you they wouldn't still be together if they didn't have me. in fact my mum has openly told me that she would leave my dad if she had enough money to move out. so that's kinda shitty

putting everything together i feel like i may have depression (and anxiety maybe?). i've talked to a few friends who have been formally diagnosed and i've described how i feel to them and generally they agree, and additionally my dad has hereditary depression, so it wouldn't shock me. now this may be a little further, but i've done a lot of research (in the time i probably should've been doing my homework) and am considering i may be bipolar. i have mood swings disconcertingly often, lack of energy, relatively short attention span. i never really experience high highs, but i often switch quickly between a average/happy mood to a depressed, wants to fall back into self harm mood. oh yeah i haven't cut in a while (thanks u/xPigingtunx). i used to cut a lot but i've managed to avoid it recently. and i am pretty sure i have anorexia, and know i had bulimia for a short period of time but that was only about two weeks and long enough ago that that doesn't really concern me anymore. but yeah i struggle to eat a meal a day even, and manage to get by on very little sleep and food.

We were together for 3+ years. Best friends for 7 years before that. In the last year of the relationship it felt like he was always working against me. Instead of it being the two of us against life stresses, he would blame me and we were no longer a team. I think he started to resent me because of my disability. I couldn't do the things I could do before. My mobility is affected and I guess I stopped being ""fun"". 

I don't feel the need to be in a relationship. I was on tinder after the break up because I wanted to enjoy being single and figuring out who I am and just meeting people and having a good time. This guy M just blind sided me to be honest. I wasn't expecting it to be more than a fan situation but i feel a connection with him that has made me start falling for him.

I think I am good company! My issue is that with my disability I can't work so all I do is sit at home and be lonely and it is quite isolating but I have lots of interests and i keep up with news and events and do research so that my mind stays as active as possible despite not being able to physically do much. 

My self esteem is damaged partly because of my disability because I'm not who I was and I'm having a hard time accepting that. I still get very upset at the life I no longer have. I feel like I'm a stain on society because I can't contribute with working and taxes and stuff and that gets me down. I've always been taught that I can do anything and I've always worked hard but this is a huge struggle and though I hope to learn how to manage so I can eventually work, it's taking a very long time. 

Another reason behind my low self esteem is my relationship with my ex. There was an event where he tried to gaslight me and I called him out on it but after we split I realised that was one of many times he did that, it just didn't work that one time. He blamed me for so many things and just made me feel like I was a burden more than anything else. After the split, i realised a lot and realised that I am not those things but the insecurity still creeps in and makes me feel like I'm not good for anything. The last year we were together, he had just graduated and neither of us were working. I somehow managed to keep us financially afloat for a year but it was getting to the end of that time and that's when he broke up with me... essentially I couldn't pull anymore money out of my arse so he had to get a job. Breaking up around that time made me feel like I was no longer useful to him so he broke up with me","(these are my observations as a human in the wild, i'm not a professional, just an ear to listen, as it were)

was he with you before your disability or was he there when it began?  the way i see it, if that's the case, then you didn't change, he did.  that has nothing to do with you.  i can relate to this very much though my own outcome was different.  

your ex -- not many good things to say about him, but at the end, i'd say you're better off without him and his baggage in your life.  he didn't want to work and expected you to?  is that why he resented your disability?  you can't let him live rent-free in your head.  do you think you live in his?

1. Woke up, actually thought today was gonna be a good day. I had good lessons prepared and ready to go, I slept in a little more than usual, AWESOME
2. Immediately, flat tire. Go to fill up air, but....flat tire. Immediately text my supervisor dude who **gives me a super sarcastic response** and call Ford. Having a panic attack right now, btw. Hyperventilating and crying.
3. Turns out I have a spare tire (who knew?) and he put that on.
4. Got to work BARELY LATE but before I could start class my supervisor dude wanted me to go into his office before I went to class so he could yell at me about how I don't communicate enough.
5. Classes were ok. Mostly just cried during my planning because of stress and the fact that I looked up how spare tires are only meant to be driven about 50 miles under 50mph...after driving 50 miles at 60+mph.
6. Went to tire place to get tire patched. Needs to be replaced. New tire costs $100, used costs $30. I have $22 on my credit card and -$220 in the bank. So I sit in the lobby trying to figure out what to do. I don't think I let any tears out, but I was about to cry.

I didn't eat for a few days, I acted like a fool trying to get her back for a few weeks, I took out my anger on others for the next few years. I know the sickness you are feeling, and it would be my goal to help you do the least as possible damage to yourself as possible. 

You have the very unique opportunity to become a god among men here, to exit this situation completely, without any sort of fiasco or embarrassment. When people ask what happened, you have the opportunity to give the ULTIMATE burn, the ultimate win... ""She was unfaithful with my best friend, and neither of them are in my life anymore."" That's all you will say, and then change the conversation. 

Done. To those that know all of you, if you show that you are handling this with maturity, you will be given incredible respect. They will be shocked by your strength. So, that's the exterior stuff you should do. 

On the inside, I know you are a wreck. Stick around places like this to get good support. Here are the things I did to help me. 

1. Go to the gym and beat the shit out of a punching bag. Get a trainer, tell them you want to be an animal in 6 months. Put your fire into forging yourself into something completely new. 
2. Hit up old flames that understand you are not looking for something serious, who can provide you with comfort and support. I had a few good women in my life that really helped me keep my head up with just someone to text and flirt with. 
3. Move, if you want. Luckily I got out of that town and if I looked back to see where him and her where, it would probably be very depressing. Where I once felt anger, I now just feel sadness for them. They are about to experience the same pain you are in a different way, something worse. They have to live with what they did to you, and that's going to be haunting. 
4. Use your family and friends. Again, no one will ever give you anything but respect and help in a situation like this IF you continue to take the high road. 

I hate to say this because no one likes generic advice like this, but it's true. Ask yourself, ""Will this matter in 5 years?"" And as someone who looked back after 5 years, no, it will not matter. It will make you much stronger, and much kinder to others.

274,274,1.0,"So I told a 'close friend' just a couple of minutes ago that I was watching fancams of the BTS concert and he was like 'that is still going on?' as in 'my obsession'. 

I failed an important exam in May. Like THE most important for my career. It was devastating, I was in another country, away from family and... as much as I hate to say this, on the brink of a breakdown. For some reason, as I was randomly scrolling through Youtube, I discovered this video of a bunch of guys reacting to their MV. I had seen that MV before but never really put much thought to it. I loved their reactions. I wanted to know their names. I watched the MV again and one of the guys did a jacket flip... and then it began. 

I started going through Bangtan Bombs. I loved their quirks, their antics, their randomly-start-singing moments. I smiled when J-hope said he was our hope. I smiled when I saw glimpses of Jin through his shell. I smiled when I saw Tae being an absolute sweetheart. I smiled when I saw Suga preparing those little surprises for his fans.

I cried when I saw JK's surprise birthday, I bawled when Hobi saw his parents' video for his birthday, I teared up when they read their letters.

It was..  cathartic. I found myself pulling back, away from the edge. It was a release. 

They made me happy. They make me happy. They are not just an obsession. (Fuck you, 'supposedly close friend'!) 

Not ashamed to say they saved me. 

Much love, BTS - a proud fanboy.","Oh I know the feeling. I’m 24 years old and my friends and family think that I’m far too old to be fangirling over a group of guys I don’t know and that it’s ‘a phase’ (*eyeroll*).

The silver lining is that I recognize the importance of the special memories of them that get me through, so there is motivation to make as many of those with my children as possible before I'm gone.","lost my mom when I was 23 so I feel you there. Recently my wife just lost her father to alzheimers and my stop mom lost both of her parents in the last year. That lead to us cleaning out two homes this past year. My brother also sold our mom's house last year and dumped the majority of her old things on me as well. It's been a rough year between the three houses and trying to keep things from coming into my house. A lot of things were expensive and I couldn't just ditch (Father in law had a new camper, new atv, new riding mower, boat, trucker, trailer) and some things had sentimental value to my wife and I. 

To say it's been exhausting is an understatement but like it's made me appreciate things (or the lack of things) and appreciate time with my kids more. I will say my tossing skills are better than ever. I've learned what I need and what I don't and how to get rid of things quickly. I'm more orgnaized than I was before and I have less attachment to objects. 

I wish I had had more time to deal with things but maybe the pressure was needed for my own development.

Recently my wife just lost her father to alzheimers and my stop mom lost both of her parents in the last year. That lead to us cleaning out two homes this past year. My brother also sold our mom's house last year and dumped the majority of her old things on me as well. It's been a rough year between the three houses and trying to keep things from coming into my house. A lot of things were expensive and I couldn't just ditch (Father in law had a new camper, new atv, new riding mower, boat, trucker, trailer) and some things had sentimental value to my wife and I. 

To say it's been exhausting is an understatement but like it's made me appreciate things (or the lack of things) and appreciate time with my kids more. I will say my tossing skills are better than ever. I've learned what I need and what I don't and how to get rid of things quickly. I'm more orgnaized than I was before and I have less attachment to objects. 

I wish I had had more time to deal with things but maybe the pressure was needed for my own development.

You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps into you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere.

Why did you spill the coffee?

“Well because someone bumped into me, of course!”

Wrong answer.

You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea.

\*Whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out.\*

Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which WILL happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It’s easy to fake it, until you get rattled.

\*So we have to ask ourselves… “what’s in my cup?”

When life gets tough, what spills over?

Joy, gratefulness, peace and humility?

Or anger, bitterness, harsh words and reactions?

282,282,1.0,"Last week, my girlfriend left me and also revealed that she has been lying to me in a really serious way since we started our relationship over a year ago. She told me that she has another boyfriend, who she had been seeing for three years when she met me. They are engaged to be married, but he gave her an ultimatum to tell me about him (he has known about me for some time apparently) and finish things.

I'm surprisingly calm, considering the circumstances. I have had a few emotional moments, but nothing I think was inappropriate.

At the moment, I'm undecided on a few decisions I need to make in response to this development:

* Should I try to contact her fiancé to check that the information she has been giving me is consistent with what she has been telling him? On one hand, I may have an ethical obligation to make sure he isn't being screwed over (but considering he is a stranger, maybe I don't) and I'm curious about how much of her story is true. On the other, it seems likely to make getting over her more difficult and could cause serious trouble if it pisses her off.

* Should I give up on romantic relationships? This is the second disastrous one I've had in a row and in retrospect my past relationships have caused me a lot of distress and needed a hell of a lot of effort. But without a girlfriend, I feel somewhat unfulfilled.","Oh my, my condolences for your terrible experience.

I don’t think you should give up on pursuing relationships. What I encourage you to do is reflect on this relationship...

-Were there signs that you missed or ignored before she broke up with you that hinted that she was deceiving you?

-What drew you to her specifically? Were you with her for reasons more than just the desire to have intimacy with someone, anyone?

-What qualities would you like or not like in your next relationship? 

-What “check-ins” can you put in place in your next relationship that could help you know where your partner is emotionally in the relationship? 

As to the question of whether you should contact her “fiancé” I try to think about these questions by putting myself in the place of the other person. “Would I want X if I were them...” If you think that you’d want to know the whole truth in his place, then you know what to do...",1.0,1.0,564,1,"Last week, my girlfriend left me and also revealed that she has been lying to me in a really serious way since we started our relationship over a year ago. She told me that she has another boyfriend, who she had been seeing for three years when she met me. They are engaged to be married, but he gave her an ultimatum to tell me about him (he has known about me for some time apparently) and finish things.

I'm surprisingly calm, considering the circumstances. I have had a few emotional moments, but nothing I think was inappropriate.

At the moment, I'm undecided on a few decisions I need to make in response to this development:

* Should I try to contact her fiancé to check that the information she has been giving me is consistent with what she has been telling him? On one hand, I may have an ethical obligation to make sure he isn't being screwed over (but considering he is a stranger, maybe I don't) and I'm curious about how much of her story is true. On the other, it seems likely to make getting over her more difficult and could cause serious trouble if it pisses her off.

* Should I give up on romantic relationships? This is the second disastrous one I've had in a row and in retrospect my past relationships have caused me a lot of distress and needed a hell of a lot of effort. But without a girlfriend, I feel somewhat unfulfilled.",2.4261966943740845,1.6694340705871582,2.982347846031189,2.646028757095337,2.880098581314087,2.044323682785034,2.1432958841323853,3.5924630165100098,1.6192277073860168,2.287948966026306,3.132368326187134,1.6999943256378174,3.9496917724609375,3.2567641735076904,1.938483476638794,1.1328063309192655,3.275496244430542,3.5004899501800537,3.779386520385742,3.1487045288085938,565,0,"Oh my, my condolences for your terrible experience.

You can come out to people on your own terms. If they have preconceived notions of you and your sexuality and they're negative that's on them.

But now i'm kind of pissed that this girl might've outed me to who know how many people, especially since I told her that I wasn't ready. and I'm kind of mad at my friend that he didn't say anything sooner, Idk I just feel like Theres no one I can trust anymore and it sucks.",2.437053680419922,1.7421197891235352,3.3120980262756348,2.1342986822128296,3.282315254211426,1.8989022374153135,2.90422797203064,3.1656758785247803,1.927072525024414,2.9796175956726074,3.4577198028564453,1.7281946539878843,3.816484451293945,3.5847373008728027,2.1074854135513306,1.0013815239071846,3.4725663661956787,3.840368270874024,3.744090795516968,3.825825452804565,575,0,"That is so, so horrible.

290,290,1.0,"The funny thing was he kept rejecting me out of fear of rejection. First as a romantic potential, to being downgraded as a friend, to a stranger. There was no way I could help his low self esteem. It’s only something he can fix. All it took was disappointing me once and he lost all confidence in us. It was very sad. He managed to reach out before, but this time...I’m not so sure. Communication has been on his terms. Our relationship has been on his terms. I had no choice except to accept things are they are (deteriorating) or walk away. He’s made decisions for us each step of the way, with no consideration for me. He’s probably on his next fix to distract from himself. That’s all I ever was, or at least how I feel now. It’s like I never existed or mattered the instant he stopped feeling validation from me.

I unfriended him but I didn’t block him. I just didn’t want to be tempted to look at his Facebook anymore. It’ll just hurt to know he’s able to interact with others but not me. I had to end things for my own health. I felt it was very abusive the way he treated me by pushing me away. He was never mean to me ever. But the ghosting I felt was cruel and inhumane and I didn’t deserve that. He told me be done more for him than anyone else. But it seems he’d rather invest his energy towards others, towards people who mattered less. It’s like he forgot I am human too and am allowed to be upset or feel sad.

I tried reaching out several times. My own best friend did too behind my back which pissed me off. I didn’t ask her to and when she told me, I was livid. I felt this was between me and him. She was my support system but in no way I felt she had the right. But honestly, I knew she was just looking out for me. She couldn’t take it anymore seeing me so hurt, so I understand. She meant to be kind to him too but he probably ignored her just like he did with me.

I sent him a card with a hand drawn “picture” of us. I have a real photo of us, a selfie, but I never shared it with him. And we shared a moment we didn’t take a photo of, so I drew it instead to capture that memory. I left an open ended message hoping it’d be a nice memory to think of when he needs some lightness.

If Im honest, part of the reason why I quit was because his loud silence through all my efforts made me feel like a weirdo. I don’t want to be seen as obsessive for trying. I always believe it’s not worth it trying so much if someone lets you feel so worthless. It’s unkind. It’s unusually cruel. Honestly, I’m worth more than that. I value him as a person but I also value myself too.

I’ll never know why he did this. I wish I knew so I can heal. But it’s like having a shrapnel embedded in you and any wrong movement can just trigger the pain or deepen it. Ive been walking around with shrapnel in me for half a year now. I’m just very sad and hurt and go to bed crying every night, not knowing what happened. Maybe I never will.

I think you telling your friends bye was a greater kindness than you’d know. Because at least you gave them closure in a way. My health has been wrecked and I’m in therapy because of the pain this caused.

Thanks, I hope he reaches out one day. But at this point I want it for me. I can’t care about what he thinks or feels anymore. It’ll just drive me mad.","Damn reading that makes me sad.

292,292,1.0,I GOT DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND I CAN BARELY MOVE ANYMORE FUCK THIS EARTH,"Very sorry to hear that. I have a good idea of what you must be feeling. I got diagnosed with extremely aggressive symmetrical rheumatoid arthritis when I was 22. Basically, both my shoulders went to hell, then all the joints in both hands, then both elbows, both knees, everything in both feet, bit by bit. I literally couldn't move out of bed some days. Got put on oral drugs but had to go off cuz they trashed my liver. Went on Humira, which worked great but was 35k a year to buy. Thankfully I qualified for a program through the state to get it for free. After 2 years (and pain free after the first year) on Humira, I had to go off because it was damaging my organs as well. At this point I was 25, and I went off the Humira and my doc said we would wait and see how bad the pain and swelling got when completely off my meds to see what we would try next.

The strange thing is that the pain and swelling never did come back. My arthritis has been in remission for 8 years now and the only thing my doc could think was that it was a rare form of late onset juvenile arthritis. But really no one can be sure.

I don't want to instill any false hope, but I also want to tell you it's not all darkness and despair either. I was in a bad place for a long time from all the pain and barely being able to move. Being 22 and not being able to even wipe myself some days is not something I will ever forget, but for some reason I got lucky and my body recovered. I hope you will find a way to manage your symptoms so you can live your life normally.

Gonna keep it relatively short because I don't want to bother anyone (hypocritical because I'm making the post to begin with), but I just broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years like...a few days ago. 

We had known she was moving to the states for months now, but we tried to pretend it wasn't happening. In retrospect, maybe should have broke it off earlier... 

The reason we broke up wasn't because we don't like each other (quite the contrary! I still keep in touch) but because we both know each other well enough to know that we just wouldn't want to do long distance. 

I feel...i dunno, like my heart is eating itself alive? Really shitty I guess. Look, my life is good. I get good grades, I have lots of friends, I play sports and people here I think like me too! I understand that I'm coming off as a massive jackass to some of you, probably. ""Oh, woe is me! I amicably broke up with my girlfriend!"" 

Maybe I don't even have the right to feel bad but genuinely I feel absolutely disgusting. I fucking miss her. It's just... I  feel sorta empty I guess. Like I lost part of my life. Reason I'm even telling you guys this is because while I tend to keep most of my real life to myself, this is just something that is too much for me to bottle up I think. I dunno.

Ah well, I'm young. Probably just being a over reacting asshole, who probably doesn't have the right to feel this bad, and I'm really sorry if this post comes off as me being a total asshole. Im sorry. I didn't mean to if it came off that way. 

Oh, and I stubbed my toe this morning, so that's just peachy. Hope you all had a good week though!","oiy... been there bro. broke up with my gf of 5 years this past september and some days i wake up like ""why did i even wake up today"" lol. its a gut wrenching feeling and it sucks. time helps though, as cliche as that sounds.

i will tell you somethin though, it IS good that you arent trying the long distance thing. i might be a little pessimistic but long distance is insane and sucks a huge amount of ass. i did 70 miles long distance for like a year and it was a *nightmare*. cant even imagine a different country.

dunno why she moved, but it sounds like you guys are on good terms so you never know, you could always reconnect somewhere down the road maybe. some time flying solo could be good for you.

the heart eating itself feeling will go away slowly. buncha random things are gonna remind you of her and it'll come back, but gradually its less frequent. eventually you'll go an entire day and realize you didnt really think about her at all. well thats my experience with it anyways

Are you sure it was a person that let him out? My girl can both hop the 4 ft fence and has figured out how to open the gate (have to padlock it now). They’re surprisingly clever.

","I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and I'm so sorry this experience has made all this past pain resurface with it.

Your love of your father through all of this shows me you're capable of anything, your potential is limitless. She would want to see you succeed and find joy after her passing, and how do we know she's truly gone from this plane after consciousness leaves the body?

308,308,2.0,"Thank you so much for this fantastic reply.  As it turns out, we found out today that our puppers have coccidiosis and giardia.

My heart is pretty much broken because it is my understanding that these problems usually stem from puppy mills.  We triple checked everything before we adopted, including a background check and vet check before we picked up our “kids.”  

But, we got a round of antibiotics (or whatever you call these drugs for puppers) this morning from the vet, and we will run the course.  Sadly the vet said that the “fast poops” may continue for a few days.  Not dangerous, both are eating and drinking at normal rates (for 2 lb. puppies), but a little heartbreaking when you can’t explain to them the you know they don’t feel good but that you are trying to help.    

Edit: typo","Politely butting in...though I don't disagree that they would be more at risk coming from a puppy mill, coccidia and giardia can be picked up at any time really.

I found out Friday my mom has cancer - multiple myeloma - and it feels like all self control has flown out the window.

I’ve finally gotten to my lowest weight in 5 years the day I found out and now I’m eating beyond maintenance and I’m so frustrated with myself.

The sad/awful thing is that she’s begging everyone around her to keep their health so multiple crises don’t arise at once, and I’m on track to eating my way back to 200lbs.  

This is making me realized I have a woeful lack of coping skills beyond stress eating/binging.","Hey, my dad was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multiple Myeloma 16 years ago. He found out when he broke his back while changing a car tire. He’s physically in awful shape because of his back injuries (his spine also compressed on itself), but that was more so due to his lack of motivation to do physical therapy when he should have. Other than that, the cancer is in remission and has been for a while! I believe his treatment includes Thalidomide and it appears to do a GREAT job. 

If your mom has physical injuries from the cancer (it can weaken bone marrow leading to breaks and fractures), encourage her to work through it and get back on her feet ASAP. I swear my dad would be a different person if he had just done PT and not let himself deteriorate. 

Try different chemotherapy treatments until she finds what works best for her - they have come leaps and bounds with multiple myeloma and it is not a death sentence. She sounds like a strong woman if she’s concerned about the people around her more than herself. If my dad can win at this bitch of a cancer for so long, I know she can too.  

And please give yourself a break. Try to get back on track, but cancer is a horrible and scary thing and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for feeling weak at such a difficult time. It’s still new. Let yourself process for a few days. ❤️❤️❤️",1.0,1.0,630,1,"I’m gonna make a fat rant about myself

You probably had some really valuable or sentimental things on your account, so I'm sorry about that. But nearly everyone get's scammed/phished like this at least once, with various repercussions. the best thing you can do is learn from this so it doesn't happen again. For some people they lose their rocket league items, others it's their identity getting stolen, bank account drained, or all of their email/data being taken hostage.

Some common warning signs/reasons to be skeptical:

- If someone asks for any passwords or personal information 

- If someone says you won something you never signed up for

- If they ask you to do something urgently or quickly, with the threat of some sort of dire consequence if you don't do it (i.e. claim in 15 mins or your Draco's will go to someone else)

- If the website you are linked to is not the official website of the organization/company/whatever.

- It's a unexpected communication from someone you don't know.

- Other things that other people can add in or are in here: https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-tips-for-spotting-a-phishing-email/.

By this time I was very happy with AP2, but I decided to talk about what happened why she ghosted me (6 months at that point) etc, she said she was upset because my response to her sharing that she got caught was of concern for myself and not her, she was expecting me to go out of my way to make sure she's ok. I disagreed with her point of view.

AP2, turns out to also be a bad communicator, ghosted after 10 months, still don't know what happened to her but most likely she got caught as well. It's been 6 months and haven't heard from her... she's alive, that I know...

Three months later I met AP2, started liking her more and more and the moment I totally forgot about AP1, she reached out. By this time I was very happy with AP2, but I decided to talk about what happened why she ghosted me (6 months at that point) etc, she said she was upset because my response to her sharing that she got caught was of concern for myself and not her, she was expecting me to go out of my way to make sure she's ok.

It sucks that you're experiencing a rough time. Sorry to hear about everything that you're currently going through.

If you need to talk it through with someone, definitely feel free to send me a PM. I know that sometimes it may feel like you're the only one on earth who's in the battle, and I know that sometimes we don't want to hear that others are going through (or have gone through) similar situations) because it can make us feel like we're either downgrading your demons or making you believe like you're not as strong as you should be, but please know that's not the case. A lot of us are there with you, passing by or permanent residents. You're strong for having the ability to reach out, even if it's just to strangers on Reddit.

I totally understand how the Leafs can be the ultimate escape in your normal, everyday life, but it's especially heightened in times like these. The community of hockey, the thrill of each play, the idea of being a part of something special, the feeling of having something to look forward too and then talking about it here - it makes a world of difference.

The next game is just around the corner, and the next one is only a couple days after that. Before then, and in-between games, try to give yourself something to look forward to or get semi-excited about (even if it just watching ""Ellen"" or the news at 6 or a movie from 8-10). In my experience, it helps a lot. Also, if you can, a 10-20 minute walk can do a world of good (around the block, going to Tim Hortons, etc. - it helps).

Again, if you want to reach out, please feel free. After sharing what you did with us, I don't feel like we're strangers anymore.

She was very sick and weak and in pain and had to be euthanized. My dad offered to take her, and I didn't go. I told you, I have a mental block about crying. I instead went to play paintball (aggressive). I cried later, a lot. That's just another time I remember wanting to be able to cry right away.

The case manager maintains that a decision had been made and the letter is in process.

When I asked my case manager about this she said they really don’t have access to the same info as the lawyers office has. It’s stressful and frustrating. I hope I don’t have to appeal again, I’m not even sure I’ll have the willpower to. But I’ve had some other health issues be diagnosed since the hearing and not that they alone would be anything to get disability for, I’d think those in addition to the depression and anxiety would be enough for them to see I cannot maintain a regular job again.

364,364,4.0,"Sorry to bring Wednesday's free talk down, but I just need somewhere to vent. My ex died Sunday morning in a horrible car accident. We were together for 11 years and in each other's lives for about 13. We got together I was 16 and he was 17 and broke up around 2 years ago; it was the best and worst relationship of my life. There are like a thousand layers to our story, most of which baffled so many people, but we just had this bond. The highs were unmatched. I can't explain it. He was abusive and a chronic cheater. And when we broke up, it was something that the universe was basically forcing upon me, because I kept going back and trying to fix him and us. 

We'd recently reconnected in Dec while he was undergoing surgery. It had taken me almost all those 2 years to be a semblance of myself again after our breakup; I moved back to NYC away from him, and created an entirely new life for myself. It was refreshing that I'd felt like I'd moved on and wasn't interested in him romantically, but would always love him as the one person who probably knew me better than anyone in the world. He was dealing with a lot because he didn't process our breakup at the time and he generally wasn't happy with himself and filled that hole with women and alcohol and drugs; when he found himself single again, he was suddenly flailing and just unable to live with himself. 

We slipped back into that routine where he'd be calling me when he needed a therapist or someone to understand him, and I relented because I knew him so well. That lead to him professing his love to me over and over, and me gently turning him down because I just couldn't put myself through that again, despite how much I loved him. Whether it was because he loved me or needed someone familiar to fill the emptiness, or a mix of both, I'll never quite know ... but it had gotten to be strenuous for me, just having to either defend myself for not being there for him or just having to see how sad he was. I knew it wasn't my place or my fault, but I still felt responsible. 

I stopped responding to him about a week ago because it was affecting my health, and I got the call Sunday afternoon from his mom. I am devastated, mostly numb. It hits me in waves. I didn't post publicly about it until yesterday night and then scores of people started contacting me. I've only been responding to my family and his family and our closest friends. I feel overwhelming amount of guilt because I can't respond to these people who love me and just want to know how I am, and keep calling, but I'm just not there. 

Has anyone ever dealt with grief that's not quite your grief to own? It's difficult because we hadn't been together in 2 years, hadn't seen each other in 2 years, but shared almost half our life together and were on good terms before he died. I don't know how to handle the people who want to help but I just can't be there right now or even respond to most of them because it's just so much, to be present and to be a person. I just kind of needed an ""anonymous"" forum to vomit these thoughts out. Thanks for listening, guys","Damn, I'm really sorry to hear this. That is a terrible situation any way you cut it. 

I've lost people who were more of secondary friends before and felt guilt about how much it affected me. This isn't one of those cases. Rest assured that any grief you feel is completely normal and well earned given the length and intensity of your relationship. He was taken from you, his family and the world before his time, which is unfair. The pain will be with you for the rest of your life, but it will become more manageable and less sharp. You will be able to look back at the happy memories you shared and smile without it making you feel like you want to throw up. 

Anybody in your life reaching out is just trying to help, and will completely understand if it takes you days or weeks to get back to them. You can lean on the people close to you - that's what they are there for.",5.0,3.0,728,1,"Sorry to bring Wednesday's free talk down, but I just need somewhere to vent.

For me, I live in what has traditionally been one of the most violent cities in the country, and at one point held the #1 title for violent crime.

When I was 5 years old, my mother was stabbed 14 times in a purse robbery by a random dude on the street. I watched her die in the hospital later that morning, and my little 5 year old brain could barely even comprehend what was happening.

Over the years, I've been on the receiving end of multiple acts of violent crime. I've had guns and knives pulled on me. I've actually been stabbed. I've been robbed. I've been jumped for no reason.

It's a tough decision to make, to either retain a victim mentality, and hope the police will do a better job to protect you, or to take your life into your own hands and decide ""enough is enough"" and start being responsible for your own safety, especially when you live in a country where even the cops are killing innocent people, and even if they're good cops, it can take them too long to reach you in an emergency.

So, it's definitely a cultural thing. I would love to feel safe without a weapon, but I don't. Carrying a gun isn't a guarantee that I'll be safe, but it at least gives me a chance at survival where one might not otherwise exist.

It jever happens quickly, and you dont want to set unreasonable goals like that, as they will just make you feel worse if they don't happen.

Instead, focus on each day and trying to work towards a fix. Thats an easier goal to accomplish, and it will propel you into trying tomorrow, and the day after. and so on. Healing and growing is hard, but not impossible, and it gets easier over time.

Also, you're still young. You're going to have horrible days for no reason at all because hormones are a hell of a drug. Being a teenager is inherently tough, but it will get a bit easier once your body and hormones calm tf down. Just take it one day at a time.

It jever happens quickly, and you dont want to set unreasonable goals like that, as they will just make you feel worse if they don't happen.

Instead, focus on each day and trying to work towards a fix. Thats an easier goal to accomplish, and it will propel you into trying tomorrow, and the day after. and so on. Healing and growing is hard, but not impossible, and it gets easier over time.

Also, you're still young. You're going to have horrible days for no reason at all because hormones are a hell of a drug. Being a teenager is inherently tough, but it will get a bit easier once your body and hormones calm tf down. Just take it one day at a time.

Feel free to shoot me a PM if you want, we really do remember what it was like, and it always helps to have someone talk to.

386,386,1.0,"Man this is disappointing. I don't know much about politics but I have been watching this bill. 

I'm 23 and have been in pain every day for almost 10 years. It's really fucked up my life. The doctors haven't been able to diagnose or treat my pain, and I'm poor af because I can't work. I have to live off the sickness benefit which we already know is a joke these days. 

They all throw drugs at me, tramadol, codeine, my trips to hospital have involved up to 4 shots of fentanyl at a time. I take sleeping tablets which make me feel high as hell and NOT in a good way. I take 1200mg of gabapentin a day. I also take paracetamol and ibuprofen on top of all this. This is the only way I can have any hope of not suffering through every day of my life, but even then I've given up on feeling ""normal"". All these drugs make me nauseous obviously, but the anti nausea drugs they give me don't work. It's almost funny how many damn drugs they'll throw at me just to keep me ""sane"". Speaking of sane, I'm so sick and tired of living like this, so much so that I recently banged my head against the wall and gave myself a bad concussion. The health services have failed me over and over again. The mental health services are... Non existent for me. 

I first started using marijuana when I was 18 and suffering from withdrawals after becoming physically addicted to a heavy pain killer. 

It took away my nausea, 100%. Cured headaches. Helped me sleep better than any pill. It didn't cure my pain (where I live we don't get to chose what weed we get so I couldn't get the types of strains that help with pain) but it kept me calm, relaxed and happy. I was able to get nicely distracted from the pain and actually enjoy stuff for once. My painful episodes used to leave me feeling severely depressed, anxious, panicked. But weed changed all that. I was so elated to find something that worked, that didn't give me side effects or fuck with my body. 

But it's illegal and hard to find here. I haven't been able to get any for almost a year now and I have stopped trying. I'm so tired. I'm back on all the pharmaceutical drugs and I hate it so much but I don't have a choice. They mess with my digestion, my energy levels, my ability to absorb nutrients from my food. My gut is absolutely fucked. I eat really well, I move when I can, I have hobbies and I'm trying everything I can. But I'm still very sick. I'm in so much pain, day in and day out. 

I would love to come off all these pharma drugs. I would LOVE to not be a criminal. I would love to be able to access the right type of weed, grown by a trustworthy source. And have it be affordable. This result today is discouraging but I am still glad we're talking about it, and trying. I'm in bad shape but I know others have it much worse off than I do, and I'd love them to get the medicine they need too. This country would be better off. 

Take the power away from the gangs, get us sick folk some safe marijuana so we can just put down the fucking pill bottles, chill out with a bong, eat our dinner and have a good nights sleep. God knows we fucking deserve it.","Man, until you mentioned the specific drugs you were on, I thought I found my brother's account. Exactly the same situation. It took him much longer to find marijuana as a way to kill the symptoms of withdrawals (from the prescribed fentanyl/oxy), but his quality of life is so much better for it. I am glad parliament is considering medicinal marijuana for terminal illness, but chronic pain is a much more prevalent condition and so much suffering could be prevented that legislation was made a little broader.

This problem has been made so much worse in the last couple of years by the restrictions placed on GPs and pain clinics regarding opiods - many people on them for chronic pain have to go through Drug and Alcohol Services, who are simply not equipped to deal with treatment chronic pain and generally want to take them off those opiods with no effective withdrawal relief.",1.0,1.0,772,1,"Man this is disappointing.

Take it as a blessing dude. We live in such fast times now and many girls have had bad experiences with ""fuckbois"" that once they hear you haven't slept with any girls; some will see it as more a positive than a negative. 

The best I can say here is to try approach your dates with the thought of hooking up and having sex completely out of the picture, ask alot of questions and listen well. Make them laugh and relax, first dates can be pretty nerve wracking but find a good subject that you both might be comfortable on and get some humour going. After the while if you make past more than 1 date, you should feel a little more comfortable in saying you have never slept with girls.

 When I broke it to the girl I was still a virgin I literally said it in so much confidence that she saw it as a turn on. Something along the lines of ""Yea I'm gonna be honest I don't fuck around with girls feelings and emotions because I see it all too often and it just leaves people hurt"" I then went on to spend 3 years of my life with this girl and we had very amazing sex for that 3 Years. There is hope for you my man, be confident in yourself! Quality over quantity man, I've slept with some beautiful girls on Tinder who weren't very good because chemistry just wasn't there. Personality trumps all looks and you Will soon realize once you have sex that it's all pretty much the same unless you connect on a really good level.

389,389,1.0,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, about to turn 4. Some policemen showed up at the door to my house, talked to my mom for awhile, and she started screaming and crying. I was confused, since I loved policemen. They're helpful and strong and friendly, right? How could they make my mom cry like that?

They told me the same thing. My father was dead.

I've always wished I could remember anything about his life. I've seen pictures, and I've heard stories about what he was like from the people whose lives he touched, but that never felt like enough. I wanted to remember him in some way personal to me. I was his only child, and everyone tells me how much he loved me, even to this day. That his love could leave that much of a mark on people, but none apparent on me, was something I could never accept easily.

He had gone from his home town in Kouchi prefecture, Japan, to the United States to work at his friend's business. He was a travel agent. Not a glorious or superb position by most measures, though he certainly didn't mistake his work for his life. He was known by the community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man you would trust with your most valuable things. Still, I find it ironic that as I'm preparing to make the same journey he did now that new year's is over, from my grandparents' house back to the city I grew up in, that even as I've been successful in life by any metric, that I could never find whatever part of my soul it was that belonged to him.

Would he have been proud of his daughter? Anyone who has a father would know that the answer is yes, regardless of my material circumstances. But I never had the luxury of hearing this from him. ""Your father would be so proud of you"" stopped feeling good at some point, and began to sting.

I watched Uchouten Kazoku last year. If you're not aware, one of the main themes of the show has to do with the protagonist dealing with his father's death and legacy. Souichirou Shimogamo was a great man. He was respected by his community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man who could save the world. Yasaburou seeks to measure up to him. Yajirou hides his feelings because he lost his completeness. Yaichirou wants to have his own family. Yashirou desires a fun life.

I am these characters. All of them, all parts of me interacting on the screen, finding themselves and helping each other. I had come to terms long ago with the fact that I would never get whatever it was that I was looking for from my father. Uchouten Kazoku showed me something more valuable than that: my father wouldn't even want me to try.

When something hurts emotionally, it's because it's important. Your cat was important to you, and obviously still is. When they reach out, it might be painful, but if it's painful that may be a sign that you need more time to process that grief. I know feeling that kind of grief over a pet can feel silly, but it's real love. I bet that cat was there for you during some incredible heartbreaks.

You're not crazy for feeling those things, and it might be helpful for you to let yourself feel those feelings.

But sadly most people don't see it that way, and are too deluded by the whole ""blessing of life"" rhetoric to ever support assisted suicide; also the idea that it will be misused by immoral, selfish cunts doesn't help.",2.68143630027771,1.6449412107467651,3.224824905395508,2.561825394630432,3.19697642326355,1.9811567068099976,2.280499219894409,3.639498710632324,1.7113357186317444,2.676428198814392,3.069546222686768,2.278754472732544,3.7659409046173096,3.0796561241149902,2.184572577476501,1.823025643825531,3.205824375152588,3.3962271213531494,4.029197931289673,4.14207124710083,3.838714361190796,3.678473711013794

We've been together for almost 3 years and had an amazing relationship, she's known that other guy for less than a month. It confuses me so much how someone can just throw away so much of what we built for a fucking fling or whatever. I'm in a dark place, /r/soccer has been my refuge. Fuck my life","Ah fuck that’s tragic. Impossible for you to see now but this is going to be a really positive and important time in your life. You’re gonna hear it a lot because it’s true but take this time to get in physical shape, build confidence in ways you couldn’t when you were with this girl. 

My girl of two years left me for some guy and I found out she was fucking him for months before she told me. I had the same reaction as you, can’t eat, can’t get up, just feeling like your foundation has imploded. Writing in a journal was hugely beneficial to me maybe that will help you. 

I started socializing and staying busy on weekends/after school out of necessity (and spite) because I couldn’t let her win. I went to concerts, took trips, joined clubs, and documented it all on social media. Was it a bit sad and transparent st times?

My girl of two years left me for some guy and I found out she was fucking him for months before she told me. I had the same reaction as you, can’t eat, can’t get up, just feeling like your foundation has imploded. Writing in a journal was hugely beneficial to me maybe that will help you.

Your mom lives on inside of you. All the neurons of your brain have been shaped by her. Your brain is a physical manifestation of the impact she had on the world.

The cliche phrase ""They're not gone, they're alive, in here"" /points to heart"" is true, but they pointed to the wrong organ. The people we love are alive inside of us. They helped mold and shape our brains, our character, the way we are.

I had a friend who died of Pancreatic Cancer, very suddenly. He was a childhood friend, named Andrew. In 5th grade, Andrew convinced me to try a Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. It's the only thing I've ever ordered after that.

Andrew is gone, but he changed me indefinitely. I love Western Bacon Cheeseburgers and that's directly because of him. Whenever I travel to a state with a Carl's Jr., I go get a Western Bacon Cheeseburger and think of him. 

Your mom has literally shaped you, if there's anything that reminds of your mom, maybe you can take tomorrow or one of your days off to go do something that you love because of her. 

Or just hang out and pretend she's there. You'll seem like a crazy person, but that doesnt matter, because your mom IS there. When we imagine ""What would &lt;so and so&gt; say about that!"", that's the part of them that's still alive. We've interacted with them so much that it's like writing data to a hard drive. Our mom's leave data written all across our brains. To some extent, the people we love have copied their consciousness in to our own brains.

She's still in there, inside of you. She's not gone, it's not just empty memories. Try to take it easy, think of the pleasant memories and reinforce them. Cry a lot, drink, eat, smoke, and keep the memory of your mom alive in your mind.",1.0,1.0,802,1,My birthday is tomorrow and my mom died three days ago now.

I've been to a counselor before, but I'm kinda like you, I know I should go, but stubborn enough that I haven't gone back. I didn't call today since I wanted to focus on work.... or just stubborn and making excuses.

Sigh, I need to do something to occupy myself, maybe get a win in my corner with something.  I thought doing good at work would fix that,  but I guess not. Might need too find a different job.

410,410,1.5,"So I just created a new account for this... The reason why is, I'll probably never see the replies for this. I'll log-off and never log back in again. I just wanted to talk about this, ""say it out loud"". I've kept this hidden from everyone so far.

After losing my parents at a young age, and getting taken into my godparents house, I had everything I wanted as a child. My foster parents were never rich, but I never missed out on anything, they did everything they could to raise me. At the age of 18, I started taking care of my own finances, I received money from the government for being an orphan. At age 18, I was receiving 2.8k without doing anything, just finishing up school. Everything went downhill from there. I didn't have spare a second thought about spending money. I spent everything as fast as I received it. I lived a lifestyle of doing and buying everything I wanted.

I entered one of the best universities in my country, but switched courses three times before quiting altogether. The money stopped coming at age 21. I didn't have much saved up. And the reserves quickly disappeared. Worst thing is, I was an idiot. I think I still am. I kept my lifestyle, didn't ajust to the new budget I had. I still spent without caring, and that went on for 3 more years. Now, at age 24, I'm employed by the city hall of my city, making a little over minimal wage, without college education, and with credit cards debts.

At the very least, I want you to know you are not an idiot.... please don't beat yourself up on that. The first step to becoming better is to do what you just did today... and admit it to yourself. 

From here on out, it will be a tough climb, and all I can offer is nice words and encouragement, but you must get out of this mindset and finally look at yourself and start to change....inside and out.

",2.0,1.0,820,1,"So I just created a new account for this... The reason why is, I'll probably never see the replies for this. I'll log-off and never log back in again. I just wanted to talk about this, ""say it out loud"". I've kept this hidden from everyone so far.

After losing my parents at a young age, and getting taken into my godparents house, I had everything I wanted as a child. My foster parents were never rich, but I never missed out on anything, they did everything they could to raise me. At the age of 18, I started taking care of my own finances, I received money from the government for being an orphan. At age 18, I was receiving 2.8k without doing anything, just finishing up school. Everything went downhill from there. I didn't have spare a second thought about spending money. I spent everything as fast as I received it. I lived a lifestyle of doing and buying everything I wanted.

I entered one of the best universities in my country, but switched courses three times before quiting altogether. The money stopped coming at age 21. I didn't have much saved up. And the reserves quickly disappeared. Worst thing is, I was an idiot. I think I still am. I kept my lifestyle, didn't ajust to the new budget I had. I still spent without caring, and that went on for 3 more years. Now, at age 24, I'm employed by the city hall of my city, making a little over minimal wage, without college education, and with credit cards debts.

Because of this my mental health took a hit. There was a period of about 5 months I only left the bed to work. I didn't go see any of my friends.

Tell your loved ones you're well but emotionally you're up and down and need their love and understanding. 

In my experience, everyone really wants to love and support you in your pregnancy but isn't sure how. Enjoy your MIL, enjoy yourself and don't get caught up in him, you only have a limited time to yourself now. Spend your time organising and doting on yourself. 

As for the morning sickness, you simply can't let yourself stress it. It's awful (I'm 22wk and still puke at 0630 everyday) but it will settle. For me, I can't let myself get anywhere near hungry.

Tell your loved ones you're well but emotionally you're up and down and need their love and understanding. 

In my experience, everyone really wants to love and support you in your pregnancy but isn't sure how. Enjoy your MIL, enjoy yourself and don't get caught up in him, you only have a limited time to yourself now. Spend your time organising and doting on yourself. 

As for the morning sickness, you simply can't let yourself stress it. It's awful (I'm 22wk and still puke at 0630 everyday) but it will settle. For me, I can't let myself get anywhere near hungry. Protein and good fats really help me feel full, like banana on toast, or peanut butter in a smoothie.


Don't stress, you're made for this gig.

416,416,1.0,"Thanks for your reply. The breakup happened more in the aftermath of this that I didn't go into in my post. I can see why you think it's unfair so I'll go ahead and explain it. Since we had gotten engaged things had been difficult, especially around planning this wedding. Last year I moved 3,000 miles to be with him and recently started a new job. In the meantime, I was working on planning our wedding and I did about 99 percent of the work. His family had a lot of demands which I accommodated- however, anything I considered saying 'no' to, he would yell and scream at me. This got worse and worse as time went by, to the point where at times he became nonverbal and was just screaming. He would talk or interrupt me talking and then tell me he was too stressed out and that the 'discussion was over' and then blame me for his yelling and screaming. This was bad enough that I requested professional counseling. After seeing this scene that happened at Church, I now realize that he was probably EXTREMELY stressed out by the prospect of saying 'no' to these people about anything for fear that they would do something like this. His typical method of dealing with his family is to just say 'yes' to what they want so that he doesn't have to deal with their drama. His stepmother also caused issues by spreading rumors about me (saying things like how could my family let me leave home and move away and that meant I wasn't a chaste girl, asking invasive questions about my parents' divorce that happened 25 years ago, talking about my engagement ring and its cost). His dad was frequently in contact with my father who very kindly, and repeatedly, asked that they take a step back because they were causing me a lot of stress in what should be a fun process. About 2 weeks before this happened my dad expressed concern that they might do something at my bridal shower and basically told me I didn't have to get married if I don't want to because he has a lot of concerns about this family and the way they were treating me and their son. 

After the event in the main post happened, we went to see the priest of my family's Orthodox church (our officiant), who spent almost four hours talking us through everything. He told my fiancé that what his father and family did at my bridal shower was extremely inappropriate and that their behavior over the wedding planning process (which I didn't get into in my post as either for the sake of length) had been disrespectful and that the right thing to do would be to have his family mend fences with me. He also suggested counseling to work on communication. He told me with the Church people who acted that way in the bridal shower what they did was wrong as well but if my fiancé and his family can have a change of heart then he thinks they will also because they were told a one sided story, and if they don't it's on them. 

My fiancé went back to his family to talk to them about this and each and every one of them denied that their actions were wrong whatsoever and refused to apologize to him or me for their behavior in publicly humiliating us both at my bridal shower, and persistently harassing me over 10 months of wedding planning. [When I say harassing, I mean constant texts and phonecalls to both of us, they wanted to decide EVERYTHING from the guest list, who would officiate, what languages the service would be in, and who would escort MY MOTHER down the aisle. The vast majority of the stuff that they asked for, they got. Everything I picked was 'too expensive' even though my family was paying for those things. Constantly wanting to add more people to the guest list even though we almost had 400 people and starting to say things like ""well your brother's wedding had empty seats so if some extra/uninvited people show up that should be fine"" and ""we should set some empty tables just in case.""]

So he came back to me and basically said, I was wrong for ""letting myself"" have a panic attack and being late, that yes they did something wrong but that I 'overreacted', that I should have given into all of his family's demands because it's 'just a wedding' and they 'need to control' the wedding because weddings are important in their culture, and that he is a part of his family no matter how they behave and will not ask them for any more apologies or keep talking to them about this because they 'don't agree' that what they did was wrong. He said 'they agree' about putting the wedding on pause so that 'the next time around we can all come to the table and they can tell me what we need to do.' He begged me to just let them control this one day so that we can get married and I said it's not about the wedding it's about this behavior and the fact that I cannot deal with it for the rest of my life, especially with someone who will not empathize with me or emotionally support me. Furthermore, I don't believe it would stop at the wedding. The next thing will be his father 'needs to decide' our baby's name or what kind of house we should buy and I'll be berated until I say yes. We continued to discuss this over a period of a couple weeks and had another counseling session with the priest who did our premarital counseling. My fiancé also refused to listen to the advice we were given there which is that he needs to have some boundaries with his family, not allow his spouse to be humiliated in public, and be empathetic to my feelings rather than constantly putting me down while excusing what his relatives do. Instead, in the past few weeks, I was called every name in the book including ones beginning with C, MF, B, etc. Obviously at that point I was not willing to move forward so I went and asked my brand new boss to help me transfer my job I just started to where my nearest family members live, 2,500 miles away from here. Obviously this is a lot of info but I wanted to answer your question, this just doesn't really fit with the theme of the original post so I didn't include it.","L,

I posted here a few weeks ago about having a ton of anxiety in early pregnancy. And now it's like...oh, hey, the worst possible thing is happening. But I'm still here, I'm getting through it, and I just have to deal with it.

I go back and forth between utter sadness, tears, etc to a more logical ""well, it wasn't viable, it's just biology, my body reacted the right way and we can absolutely try again."" We got pregnant the first month we tried and we kept thinking it was too good to be true.

If anyone has a story of getting pregnant after a MC, please share it. I want to feel hopeful. Also, I need to unsubscribe from a billion ""your baby is the size of a blueberry"" emails now. Ugh.

Edited to add: oh my god, thank you all so much for your kind words, stories, and support. This sounds silly but this community has made a horrible day so much better. It's such a relief to know that others understand what I'm feeling so perfectly, and have found joy on the other side. You are all the best.","Oh my heart is breaking for you.  I just want to give you a hug.  Grief is a funny thing and you feel like you are OK one minute and then the next minute you are on the floor unable to move.  I had a miscarriage in March of 2015.  It was my first pregnancy and I had no idea how common they were.  I got pregnant again 6 months later.  My daughter is 18 months old now and a joy and a miracle in my life.  It did help me to know so many of my friends and family members had also had miscarriages and had gone on to have healthy pregnancies.  That is also SO common.  Having a baby after a miscarriage did help tremendously with my grief.  I know that is not the case for all.  However, it took a lot of time.  My second pregnancy was filled with anxiety and I never felt truly like I was going to really have a child until she was literally in my arms.  I had to process a lot of negative emotions about that miscarriage taking the joy of pregnancy away from me.  But, here we are almost 3 years later and our life is beautiful and blessed.

Be kind to yourself through your grief.  Whatever emotions come up are OK and normal.

443,443,1.0,"I resonate with that. My sister also has DS. Let me tell you what happened to us:

It drove my mother to commit suicide last year. It completely ruined my family (my parents divorced and subsequently my mother became very depressed, my father became a drunk and my other sister left and is no longer in contact with us because she thinks my parent neglected her because of my DS sister).

 Now that my mom is dead I have to take care of my sister (my father doesn't give a shit so I have guardianship). I have to admit that I'm totally burnt out and I'm starting to hate my sister. I can’t help being frustrated and bitter. I know it's not her fault (she didn't choose to be born like that) and I feel bad for feeling that way. I'm stuck and will never be able to have a normal life or just be free. I’m 25 and I have literally no future. I just can't do it anymore and every time I look at my sister I resent her for destroying my future. 

She’s not that high-functioning (she’s mentally around 7-8 yr old) so she goes to a Day Program for people like her. However when she comes home in the evening, I start to get frustrated because I wish I could have a night on my own, just relaxing and not thinking about what’s for supper, her medications, laundry etc….
As a result, I barely talk to her except when I ask her to do something. I can’t really connect with her, she only likes childish things and she asks the same questions again and again. 

I don’t know how to deal with all the guilt, the hate, the sorrow, the bitterness and the dark ideas I have. I even considered killing my sister and then myself to end it all but I know would not be very unfair to her. I’m so envious of my friends who are now starting families or go on vacation while I can’t do all of these things.

My girlfriend never knew my brother, but she understands how much i loved him, and in tears she asked me how long i would grieve him. It was the first time she has faltered in her support of me, and the first time I've realised my grief had been affecting her so much.

I tell people it gets easier after being through it so much (10 funerals since I graduated in 2008), but it never does. There are two of them that will never leave my heart/thoughts, one was a friend that lost his battle with sarcoma before he was 21 and the other took their own life almost 2 years ago. That one will never leave me, it was the only person (so far) that I truly loved.

Some people will never know how it feels to be the last phone call someone makes, and to be able to recall every single word of the call. A month later a Deadpool bobble-head key chain I bought them the last time we hung out showed up in my mail. It is with me everyday, it is the only tangible memory that I have left. I'm thankful everyday though that the last thing we were able to say to each other was ""I love you"".

I tell people it gets easier after being through it so much (10 funerals since I graduated in 2008), but it never does. There are two of them that will never leave my heart/thoughts, one was a friend that lost his battle with sarcoma before he was 21 and the other took their own life almost 2 years ago. That one will never leave me, it was the only person (so far) that I truly loved.

Some people will never know how it feels to be the last phone call someone makes, and to be able to recall every single word of the call. A month later a Deadpool bobble-head key chain I bought them the last time we hung out showed up in my mail. It is with me everyday, it is the only tangible memory that I have left.

There was never any direct “thanks for fucking” text but the one which was burnt into my mind is a night in 2016 where the other person asked her to come over, she said she could but had to be at home by 8 because I was going to the gym, then she said she would be there soon.

You could ask your wife if she has ever cheated on you, maybe not as direct like that, but something along those lines. One ""trick"" is to hold up something, lets say a towel. If it's a white towel, tell her to tell you it's a blue towel (Any colour really), then ask her to tell you the towel is white.

He’s threatened violence on us before and gotten angry because we didn’t do enough for him. He blames me, my father, my mother, everyone other than taking responsibility for his own actions. My father, the most godly man I know still tries to help him. He and I have paid money we didn’t have at the time for treatment. We used to get him jobs but I will no longer vouch for him as I will no longer risk my reputation because he never stay. His last job he stole the work truck, drove it 200 miles and just left it on the side of the road.

I’ve pleaded. I’ve bribed. I’ve begged. I’ve I’ve yelled. Nothing works. I’ve taken council from hardened reformed criminals who have taken him in and tried to get him on the right path.

He started using when he was 16. He’s an alcoholic. When he gets out of his 2-3 years stents he does in county he’s clean but usually gets right back to it as soon as he’s out.

 His friend that he used to run with “grew out of it” at least that’s what they tell me when they see me and get updates from me about him. 

It’s so easy to hide behind idealism but reality is often very different. Don’t tell me they are a product of their environments or how their families treat them. Let me ask you a question, what about their families? The beauty of it is, he thinks he’s entitled to something. He blames us. He blames the police. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. It might be harsh but the truth is harsh. Some people aren’t worth saving. I’m not saying get rid of them but we don’t have to save them. It’s not a popular notion but yes I value some people over others. The person whose trying to actually work to better themselves rather than the moocher. I didn’t learn his from a blog or at some political rally I learned this from my own experiences.

My attitude is just fine. It’s this assumptive bleeding heart attitude that needs to be rethought. Never before has there been so much arrogant entitlement as there is now. If someone can snort cocaine and still work an assembly line then more power to them, I’ll agree with 100% that the government needs to leave that said coke head assembly line worker alone, but you are wrong to ask society to pay for the moochers, like my brother.","And here you express the honest heart of the matter that so many libertarians are disingenuous about: you don’t want to help certain people.

He and I are from the same family, had all of the same opportunities, lived in the same house, drank the same water, everything. He was also 6 years older than me and single handedly ripped my mothers sanity to the point of mental collapse. He’s threatened violence on us before and gotten angry because we didn’t do enough for him. He blames me, my father, my mother, everyone other than taking responsibility for his own actions. My father, the most godly man I know still tries to help him. He and I have paid money we didn’t have at the time for treatment. We used to get him jobs but I will no longer vouch for him as I will no longer risk my reputation because he never stay. His last job he stole the work truck, drove it 200 miles and just left it on the side of the road. I have openly wept in a public restaurant because I was having to feed my older brother, someone I’d admired at one time. I’ve begged him to like a pathetic child to get his act together. I’ve pleaded. I’ve bribed. I’ve begged. I’ve I’ve yelled. Nothing works. I’ve taken council from hardened reformed criminals who have taken him in and tried to get him on the right path. I’ve been told by those same people that it’s a lost cause. 

He started using when he was 16. He’s an alcoholic. When he gets out of his 2-3 years stents he does in county he’s clean but usually gets right back to it as soon as he’s out.

 His friend that he used to run with “grew out of it” at least that’s what they tell me when they see me and get updates from me about him. 

It’s so easy to hide behind idealism but reality is often very different. Don’t tell me they are a product of their environments or how their families treat them. Let me ask you a question, what about their families? The beauty of it is, he thinks he’s entitled to something. He blames us. He blames the police. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. It might be harsh but the truth is harsh. Some people aren’t worth saving. I’m not saying get rid of them but we don’t have to save them. It’s not a popular notion but yes I value some people over others. The person whose trying to actually work to better themselves rather than the moocher. I didn’t learn his from a blog or at some political rally I learned this from my own experiences.

My attitude is just fine. It’s this assumptive bleeding heart attitude that needs to be rethought. Never before has there been so much arrogant entitlement as there is now. If someone can snort cocaine and still work an assembly line then more power to them, I’ll agree with 100% that the government needs to leave that said coke head assembly line worker alone, but you are wrong to ask society to pay for the moochers, like my brother.",2.6086472272872925,1.5869779586791992,2.6939648389816284,2.4997421503067017,2.8294368982315063,2.2471232414245605,2.284787058830261,3.165844202041626,1.3397321105003357,2.473046660423279,3.2212817668914795,1.7763947248458862,4.035176753997803,3.0209758281707764,2.3466521501541138,0.0483642816543579,2.9171968698501587,4.062551021575928,3.8946053981781006,2.7007886171340942,899,0,"And here you express the honest heart of the matter that so many libertarians are disingenuous about: you don’t want to help certain people.

Edit: words are hard today","I am so so sorry that you're going through this. My mother had cancer for 12 years, since I was thirteen, so I had to go through that with her during my formative years. It's definitely a hard journey, and no one ever truly knows what you're going through \- your experience is unique to you. This can make it seem like a very lonely time, so it's super important to surround yourself with a solid support system. Also prepare yourself for people who have no idea what to say to you so all kinds of junk fall from their mouths. People get really awkward when presented with super serious situations.  


Remember to take care of yourself as well. Your mental and physical health are vital when providing support for your mom and dad. Make sure your dad is taking care of himself, as well.

My mother had cancer for 12 years, since I was thirteen, so I had to go through that with her during my formative years. It's definitely a hard journey, and no one ever truly knows what you're going through \- your experience is unique to you. This can make it seem like a very lonely time, so it's super important to surround yourself with a solid support system. Also prepare yourself for people who have no idea what to say to you so all kinds of junk fall from their mouths. People get really awkward when presented with super serious situations.  


Remember to take care of yourself as well. Your mental and physical health are vital when providing support for your mom and dad. Make sure your dad is taking care of himself, as well.

After she told me she was moving out, I immediately broke down and admitted my problems and issues and stopped drinking and really started working on myself, or so I thought.

Then when I actually had to move from our old house to a new one (still within eyesight of the old house of course) I just snapped.

17 days ago we spoke after she broke no contact, I stayed over at her place and had a couple tearful meetings the next day where she told me she loves him and would marry him ""in a second"" if he asks her.

I'm not too familiar with OTC drugs or anything but I could do some research and maybe find some possible options for you.

A lot of people find that it helps when they wake up to write down what their dream/nightmare was. I don't really know if this would apply in your case but I guess it's something to consider. There's something about getting subconscious thoughts into your conscious thoughts that makes it easier? I dunno but I thinks there's some neuroscience behind it. I figure it could be counterproductive though to have a dream and immediately go over it again, but it could be helpful. I hope you have someone to talk to about this, and a therapist would be ideal.

A lot of people find that it helps when they wake up to write down what their dream/nightmare was. I don't really know if this would apply in your case but I guess it's something to consider. There's something about getting subconscious thoughts into your conscious thoughts that makes it easier? I dunno but I thinks there's some neuroscience behind it.

","Wow.  I'm really truly sorry to hear about your friends.  I agree that everybody deserves love and affection.  Our society is really good at producing material abundance, but unfortunately is terrible at creating social bonds between people.  Modern life can be incredibly isolating, and it's tragic that you've already lost 2 people close to you to suicide.

I think the causes of the increasing suicide rate in the US are complex, and I respectfully disagree that there's a female monopoly on power in relationships.  The competition I referred to wasn't in regards to any balance of power between men and women, it was between men *for* women.

Although it may have seemed like your friends were normal, they were clearly incredibly depressed if they ended up committing suicide.  Depression takes many different forms and sometimes it can be difficult or impossible to see it until it's too late.  I think our society is particularly bad at spotting symptoms of depression in men, because men tend to manifest depression in different ways than women (where women tend to show traditionally understood signs of depression such as sadness, men will probably show irritability or anger, or engage in risky behaviors, or engage in escapist behaviors, abuse alcohol, and so on).

Our society also doesn't validate men's emotions (other than anger) and a lot of men grow up not even being able to recognize their own emotions.  I know this from personal experience.  In my family, boys crying was just straight up not allowed past a certain age.  That fucks a kid up and stunts their emotional development, and it took me a long time to get to the point where I felt comfortable even labeling my own emotions for what they are, as crazy as that sounds.",1.0,1.0,928,1,"Out of my friend group of 6 from high school, I'm the only one that's even held a girls hand and we are all about to graduate university.

Modern life can be incredibly isolating, and it's tragic that you've already lost 2 people close to you to suicide.

I think the causes of the increasing suicide rate in the US are complex, and I respectfully disagree that there's a female monopoly on power in relationships.  The competition I referred to wasn't in regards to any balance of power between men and women, it was between men *for* women.

Although it may have seemed like your friends were normal, they were clearly incredibly depressed if they ended up committing suicide.  Depression takes many different forms and sometimes it can be difficult or impossible to see it until it's too late.  I think our society is particularly bad at spotting symptoms of depression in men, because men tend to manifest depression in different ways than women (where women tend to show traditionally understood signs of depression such as sadness, men will probably show irritability or anger, or engage in risky behaviors, or engage in escapist behaviors, abuse alcohol, and so on).

Our society also doesn't validate men's emotions (other than anger) and a lot of men grow up not even being able to recognize their own emotions.  I know this from personal experience.  In my family, boys crying was just straight up not allowed past a certain age.  That fucks a kid up and stunts their emotional development, and it took me a long time to get to the point where I felt comfortable even labeling my own emotions for what they are, as crazy as that sounds.",2.389515280723572,1.314787209033966,3.0450687408447266,2.5958731174468994,3.166635036468506,2.278641700744629,2.474452495574951,3.057072162628174,1.4987451434135437,2.431154727935791,2.900612473487854,1.4932129979133606,3.9259443283081055,2.872221350669861,2.077013850212097,0.3975025415420532,3.222684144973755,3.886619329452514,3.877684831619263,3.680641651153565,4.125910758972168,4.029927015304565

467,467,1.0,"I learned the hard way a few weeks ago that a real mouse trap does not always work. We had to have traps out at my job for a rat that started living in our back room which is also the employee break room. Initially we started off with a cage trap that wasn’t working, so we used a snap trap. Poor guy got stuck in it, right around his neck too, but was so large that he didn’t actually die. An employee found it in the morning and since I’m the store manager, she called me. I was so upset. I call pest control and they suggested putting sticky traps on it and then tossing him in a trash bag.... how terrible?!


Anyways, I got myself together and got a hammer and hit the poor guy in the head like three times. It was a horrible experience. No one else at work wanted to do it either or help. They were all upset about it. It doesn’t make sense that the only person willing to kill the rat was me, someone who doesn’t even eat animals.

One day I heard this wild clacking sound and found a little guy stuck in it, flailing around and trying to get out. It was pissing and shitting itself, probably hurting itself more, and my friend just wanted to put it in a bag and whack it a few times.

Maybe I should've let him. Instead, I took like half an hour trying to pick the poor guy up, take him into the forest outside and release him. I finally did, and it had this huge mark on him from the bar. It crawled under a log and just laid there.

I try to read through the suicide watch as much as I can to try and I dunno, I suppose give a bit of support to those people on the edge reaching out? That's the first issue I've come across is that not everyone reaches out and not everyone admits when they are struggling so I'm trying to let anyone I come across know that it is ok to need help, I actually think it takes strength to admit that you can't cope and I admire those that do reach out.

 I suppose there's only so many people I can comment under and I know that some are going to slip through the net, I'm not unrealistic and idealistic enough to expect myself to be a champion that can comment under everything and sometimes all it takes is one comment to help somebody, could be delaying the inevitable but I want to at least try.

Another issue that I've come across is that there are trolls and it takes one troll to tip somebody over the edge, I'm not really into social media and I don't understand how anybody can troll a suicidal person knowing how delicate their frame of mind is. I have absolutely no control over that so I'm at a loss as to how to remedy that aspect.

I suppose if I could id like to get a few groups in different time zones and countries so that it's not all one person or a few people but that actually we as an online community can band together to make some real change and I think this forum is a great place to start because of the anonymity, nobody knows anybody's religion, ethnicity, age or history so it means people can open up with no judgement.

I like your idea about creating subs, I'm new to reddit and I have no idea how it works, this is sort of why it needs to be more than one person because it'll take different skills and different opinions, a lot of trial and error along with constant change to adapt and figure out what's needed.

I do agree with you though that those on suicide watch need urgent medical attention, I'm not gonna pretend to be God and I have no training in counselling, I suppose my main ambition( if you can call it that?) It would be to have a safety net for those one the absolute edge of life who need talked down from it, sort of urgent support to calm them while they are in that moment and to encourage them to seek long term medical help.

I understand that this is why lifeline etc fits but what I've found is that it's difficult to verbally say what's on your mind but it's so easy to write it down. I suppose I want to help those that are too afraid to speak about their pain and would rather type it.

Is there anybody else that we could get in on this? Is it worth asking the mods for advice? How do I even do that?

So she gave me cat lax to try to help the hairball and medicine to make her chill out for her next appt which was supposed to be today. 
I ended up taking her last night because she hasn’t eaten barely anything since Monday and she was having a hard time breathing. This time the vet could look at her because she was so worn out. But after X-rays and exam, they can’t find anything. So I’m at an internal medicine specialist right now for her to get bloodwork and an ultrasound. They took her back and put her on oxygen and probably sedated her so they can actually handle her. Hopefully they can fix my baby. 

As for verapamil, I’m a pharmacy tech and 1 of the brand names for verapamil is a sight misspelling of my real first name. So to pharmacy people it’s hilarious.

I was so miserable and it felt like I would never experience happiness again and when I felt a moment of joy after buying those sparkly powders, you'd better believe I chased that. 

It's been three years (as of last week) and I still miss my dad every day but the pain and grief no longer occupies my every thought. However, the makeup I bought at the time is still sitting around! If anything, I wish I hadn't bought it because of the negative associations. Like, I see the eyeshadow palette I bought driving home from dropping my sister off at the airport after dad died, and I think of that shopping trip every time. How sad I was and how I just wanted to do something normal like buy some damned eyeshadow. 

Anyway, I've gotten off track, but I just want to say: take it easy on yourself. Makeup doesn't really fix anything but time does help, and although you'll always love and miss your dad, the constant ache will ease.","Wow, I’m so sorry for your loss, that’s just awful :(. My dad had a massive heart attack while on vacation for my parents anniversary. I dropped him off at the airport and that was it. It’s been a mixture of surreality and constant grief but as you said it gets easier to shoulder as time goes on. I don’t think you got off track as well. I think you said a lot of things I can relate to here, especially the “just wanting to do something normal.” Makeup is a part of my every day life 5-7 days a week and has been for a few years.

If coping with stress at your job is hurting you mentally and physically, then finding ways to destress that actually work and aren't just coping mechanisms/escapism might be beneficial. Take care of yur body (go to the gym), take care of your mind (do shit that's mentally and emotionally stimulating, go into nature, hug some kittens).

It doesn't sound practical to leave your job right now given that you have debt to pay off, and chances are once your girlfriend finishes her degree, you'll be moving anyway.

Take this time to work on the things you'd be interested in doing. You have two years of nice financial cushion to figure what that actually is.

You can start an online business reselling almost anything through ebay and amazon, legit almost anything. I saw some people selling hot sauce packets on ebay yesterday... hot sauce packets... What the fuck is going on?!?!

You feel stuck, but you aren't. Focus on taking care of yourself so you don't burn out. Seek therapy.

This is just temporary bullshit you have to deal with, and believe me at 90k a year, you're blessed. This is your one year work anniversary, it's normal. People get tired of their jobs after 3 months, congrats you made it to a year!

so basically: 1) take care of yourself physically and emotionally 2) start working on things you enjoy in your spare time 3) pay off your debt 4) by the time your girlfriend is done you'll be debt free and have a better sense of what you might like to do, and may actually be able to do them.

478,478,2.0,"Thanks, anxiety is such a bitch. Life in general has been a bitch lately lol.  My FH is supportive, he's worried about them having hurt feelings and feeling like I don't want to be around them.  He and I have talked out a lot of these things and he understands, it's just that lately (last time we had the skids) I went to my parents for the weekend, and have been more frequent with not being around them.  Truthfully and I have told him this recently, I DON't want to be around them 90% of the time (I &amp; my therapist believe it's because they really have been triggers for me), I definitely feel guilty about those feelings since I know they are just kids, but it's the truth.  Some super serious shit went down recently with his oldest FSD14 pulling some manipulation stunts, and they are both very spoiled and entitled children.  The most recent stunt was outrageously expensive, extremely emotional, and triggered a lot of past trauma for me.  He's more concerned about how they feel when I'm not around, I am concerned about my emotional well being.  At this point I don't know when I will want to be around them, so this could be the standard for the next few months or even year.  I have used the excuse of not feeling well, or already having plans way too much, and FH is sick of coming up with excuses of why I'm not there so I am just going to tell them the truth - that I am going through a great amount of pain currently and trying to work on myself, which means I will be spending more time alone and not at home, and that it isn't their fault or their dads, but that I need to address some painful things that have recently come up.  I will tell them, (because in my heart I do feel this way) that I hope I can fully heal so that I can be a healthier and happier person for all of us.  This will take some time I think, so I don't want them thinking this is a one time weekend thing... this is going to be the new status quo for the upcoming months.. I have to separate myself from them and all the drama crap at this point because it's negatively affecting my health.  FH knows this is going to be the new norm, so he feels more comfortable with me just telling them, instead of lying or making up excuses as to why I'm not there.  Neither one of us wants them to feel like anything is their fault so we want to have a kid friendly open dialogue about stuff tonight.  I am stressed about it, but I think it's necessary.  As far as I'm concerned they won't get any other details other than for me it's a personal thing... I think the tension is also coming from a place where this is uncharted waters... I know he is happy I am seeking some healing and he understands, we both are just a little scared about where this all will leave us in the end...  Things have been really hard lately and not seeming to get better...I feel trapped, and like my life revolves around them/ I don't really get a choice in anything and just have to deal with all the shit.  I don't even know if I want to marry him anymore because of everything relating to BM, skids, the finance stuff, emotional stuff... just all of it really flooded over recently.. I need a real break and I'm sure that makes me sound selfish but I don't care anymore.  He can put his kids first like I would expect him to but I need to put myself first for a change.  When it comes to me or the kids I choose me.  This has been a hard realization. EDIT:  I know he wants me to want to put his kids first, and I won't right now because that would mean ignoring my health.  That has caused tension.","I wish he'd be more accepting of the fact that you are perfectly allowed to put yourself first and stop guilting you for it with his sads about your role and involvement not measuring up to some fantasy level standard. This pisses me off. 




When it comes to *his* kids he needs to put them first because he's their parent. He loves them like no one else every will. He's responsible for them like no on else. How can he expect you to put everything about yourself aside to serve someone else's kids? You're your own person with your own life, work, friends, family and mental health that needs to be tended. 




This life is hard and full of booby tarps! It's an emotional rollercoaster. You can't expect another person to sacrifice themselves at the alter of your children. You can't force someone to love a kid the same way you do, it just does not work that way. Children and draining even when they are yours, even when they are overall good kids, when you don't have financial, or BM drama.




My last big anxiety meltdown has been about feeling like I have nothing of my own, it's DHs kid and DHs family (because the kid is bonded with them) and me doing all the bending to fit everyone else's schedule. Sometimes I feel like a spectator in someone else's family. We're not having kids so I will never get to have that bond but I get to live through it all.



I refuse to put myself last, it's not healthy and it makes me feel like a husk of a human being. You can't except someone to sacrifice everything for a child where they literally have no control over the final say like a parent would. If I was SSs parent I would just do things because I believe it's the right thing to do and not worry about being veto, or stepping over boundaries, or losing this person I grew close to forever should my partner and I go separate ways. I will put as much in as I have to give. I will do extra and share my emotional energy when my cup is so full it's overflowing.Working like a horse, not take care of my needs and putting myself last is not the way I will ever live again.



I've been so freaking frank with DH about my feeling deep down and he's been frank with me about his. He actually did a ton of research (reddit haha!) about being with a person who deal with anxiety. We're okay. I hope you'll be okay. You do you dear. You need to be your #1 priority right now.",1.0,3.0,956,1,"Thanks, anxiety is such a bitch. Life in general has been a bitch lately lol.  My FH is supportive, he's worried about them having hurt feelings and feeling like I don't want to be around them.  He and I have talked out a lot of these things and he understands, it's just that lately (last time we had the skids) I went to my parents for the weekend, and have been more frequent with not being around them.  Truthfully and I have told him this recently, I DON't want to be around them 90% of the time (I &amp; my therapist believe it's because they really have been triggers for me), I definitely feel guilty about those feelings since I know they are just kids, but it's the truth.  Some super serious shit went down recently with his oldest FSD14 pulling some manipulation stunts, and they are both very spoiled and entitled children.  The most recent stunt was outrageously expensive, extremely emotional, and triggered a lot of past trauma for me.  He's more concerned about how they feel when I'm not around, I am concerned about my emotional well being.  At this point I don't know when I will want to be around them, so this could be the standard for the next few months or even year.  I have used the excuse of not feeling well, or already having plans way too much, and FH is sick of coming up with excuses of why I'm not there so I am just going to tell them the truth - that I am going through a great amount of pain currently and trying to work on myself, which means I will be spending more time alone and not at home, and that it isn't their fault or their dads, but that I need to address some painful things that have recently come up.  I will tell them, (because in my heart I do feel this way) that I hope I can fully heal so that I can be a healthier and happier person for all of us.  This will take some time I think, so I don't want them thinking this is a one time weekend thing... this is going to be the new status quo for the upcoming months.. I have to separate myself from them and all the drama crap at this point because it's negatively affecting my health.  FH knows this is going to be the new norm, so he feels more comfortable with me just telling them, instead of lying or making up excuses as to why I'm not there.  Neither one of us wants them to feel like anything is their fault so we want to have a kid friendly open dialogue about stuff tonight.  I am stressed about it, but I think it's necessary.  As far as I'm concerned they won't get any other details other than for me it's a personal thing... I think the tension is also coming from a place where this is uncharted waters... I know he is happy I am seeking some healing and he understands, we both are just a little scared about where this all will leave us in the end...  Things have been really hard lately and not seeming to get better...I feel trapped, and like my life revolves around them/ I don't really get a choice in anything and just have to deal with all the shit.  I don't even know if I want to marry him anymore because of everything relating to BM, skids, the finance stuff, emotional stuff... just all of it really flooded over recently.. I need a real break and I'm sure that makes me sound selfish but I don't care anymore.  He can put his kids first like I would expect him to but I need to put myself first for a change.  When it comes to me or the kids I choose me.  This has been a hard realization. EDIT:  I know he wants me to want to put his kids first, and I won't right now because that would mean ignoring my health.  That has caused tension.",2.677879810333252,1.815593659877777,3.38295578956604,2.5502644777297974,3.189918041229248,1.965867340564728,2.322986602783203,3.604050636291504,1.862515389919281,2.726377487182617,2.8970271348953247,2.360987901687622,3.7271809577941895,3.730652093887329,2.1823673248291016,1.8772042393684387,3.284065008163452,3.3350870609283447,3.852926731109619,4.165739297866821,957,0,"I wish he'd be more accepting of the fact that you are perfectly allowed to put yourself first and stop guilting you for it with his sads about your role and involvement not measuring up to some fantasy level standard. This pisses me off. 




When it comes to *his* kids he needs to put them first because he's their parent. He loves them like no one else every will. He's responsible for them like no on else. How can he expect you to put everything about yourself aside to serve someone else's kids? You're your own person with your own life, work, friends, family and mental health that needs to be tended.

It's been one of those fortnights where everything happens at once. I lost both my baby and my uncle. My mom is slowly dying and has been especially bad health-wise because of the shock. Somehow I'm holding it all together. I don't know how and it worries me. I don't understand how I am this calm. I am on antidepressants which makes me wonder if they're interfering. I'm also unwell at the moment. But how can you go from jagged raw on the floor grief for two days to just being normal but not completely there?

I don't feel like I've lost them. When I close my eyes he's sleeping peacefully. When I walk around the house it's just like his grandparents have taken him for the afternoon. I don't feel like he's actually gone. Same deal with my uncle.

Is this within the range of normal response or am I psychopathic? I don't understand how I can love so fiercely and yet after the initial part I'm able to keep on going? I just don't feel anything at all now.

Odd question to ask but I feel that most posters here have a fair bit of life experience and wisdom to share so it seems worthwhile asking.","I am so sorry for your losses!

The antidepressants may be interfering with your emotions right now, for sure. But it's also completely normal to react the way you are reacting.  It could be because you need to function right now and can't afford to fall to pieces (arrange funerals and all of that).  It could be that your mind knows you can't deal with it all just yet and so it will dole out the grief in pieces over the next year - or in one big hit later on when you can deal with it more easily.  It may be shock, that even though you know what has happened and is happening, at the same time you haven't truly accepted it all so there is nothing to grieve yet. Could be another reason entirely.

We all deal with these things differently, we have different ways of reacting.  For myself, I had to be strong when my father died the other year, so I could help my mother function in arranging what had to be arranged.  I didn't have the time or luxury to grieve properly.  Every now and then though I would feel something building inside of me, and I knew it was because I actually needed to and wanted to break down and fall to pieces.  So each night what I would do is go for a hot shower and just sit in there under the water.  Sometimes I would cry and let my tears mingle with the water, sometimes I would just sit and not think or feel, just stare at the wall and the water.

What can any of us do? We just have to hold out hope that if we at least try our hardest we can make it to some future reality that is worth our efforts in the present. Be sure to take care of yourself - repeating a year of school is far better than pushing yourself into an unhealthy state of mind. Do what you can, and perhaps schoolwork would be a good distraction from everything that’s going on. I didn’t do that for sure. What helped me was getting away to a coffee shop or something for a few hours to work. I was able to remove myself from my toxic household and pour myself into something else for awhile.

485,485,1.0,"Tbh i feel like it’s ruined my life. 
I had sinus infections a lot as a kid, probably had more antibiotics than the average kid, but the infections were always controlled with antibiotics. 
I got this infection in 2014 when I was living in London. I’m from Australia where the air’s pretty clean. The pollution and smog in London definitely made my sinuses worse and the nature of the public health system in London wasn’t ideal for me because each time I went back to the dr I’d end up seeing a diff practitioner and after 9 months of living there, i’d been on over 10 diff types of antibiotics. I think this definitely contributed to the infection now being antibiotic resistant.
I came home and had various surgeries which didn’t help. Went on diff medical trials which unfortunately weren’t effective for me. 
I feel like it’s ruined my life because I’m studying post grad opera. I managed to study for a year in 2015, but my voice was very husky and on and off and I haven’t been able to sing in the 3 years since. The chronic infection leaves me with a constant post nasal drip which irritates my lungs, that makes me cough pretty much constantly and all the coughing has damaged my vocal folds. For a few years I had polyps on my vocal folds. They’ve healed now, but I can’t stop coughing still which means my vocal folds are constantly swollen and I can’t sing. I’ve now moved across the country to this great performing arts school and haven’t been able to sing once or participate in any of the singing classes or operas in the last 3 years which has been a living hell. Soooo yeah. I’m now so out of shape vocally and multiple teachers have told me I can’t pursue a career in music with such unreliable health and that now I’m getting too old esp having not sung for years. Pursuing another career isnt really an option because it’s the only thing that I’m super passionate about so I’m just kind of living in limbo til my sinus health improves.

A few years ago I dated an amazing nurse in Vandy's Neuro ICU, who then broke up with me out of the blue.  I loved her and was having a really hard time of it, so my brother started running with me just to hang out with me and get me out of the funk.   It worked.   

We started competing.  I'd run 40 miles a week and feel proud, only for him to show me his Fitbit and see that he'd ran 100 miles that week.  He's the only person I've ever met that could kick Tony Horton's ass any day of the week and ask for seconds.

We took this pic when we were running in Centennial Park on a broiling Sunday afternoon in August.   It's one of my favorite photos of him, just because.  It was worth going through the breakup, just so I could have it.

I had to share that because I'm sitting at the hospital by his side, watching helplessly as the last thread holding him to this world starts to unravel, and there's not a thing I can do to stop it.  In 44 years on this planet, I've never known a worse feeling.

Go see your brother or sister.  Call your parents and ask them how their day was.  Go see granny and grandpa one Sunday and have lunch with them.  Tell them you love them every chance you can.

491,491,2.5,"Thank you. I believe a pain management doctor who saw me in the hospital years and years ago at the height of my diagnosis put some kind of flag in my file.

My mom was almost always with me because I was still only around 20-21 at the time and I'd never even been to an ER before my Crohn's let alone one hospital admittance after another. So this house pain doctor walks into my room and basically says too bad, nothing he can do and I started crying. My mom was there, she was in tears. I was devastated as it is. My life was ripped out from under me (I missed my college graduation during my first hospital stay). I was scared. I was in pain. I couldn't get any help. Doctors didn't seem to have any clue what was going on with me because I also had a horrible case of c-diff at that time, but didn't know it because the doctors were too incompetent to even test me for it. So yeah of course I fucking cried. I was crying for a lot of reasons. But these people weren't helping me with ANYTHING. The very least I was getting was a little help with pain and then he walks in and says I can't even have that. I cried every time I was in the hospital in front of many doctors because those were hands down, the worst years of my life. Now here I am 10 years later and I'm not in pain to the point of hospitalization all the time like I was before, but I still have very real health problems that cause chronic pain. I can't even get a doctor to listen and I think that's the hardest part. I feel like I get written off before I even walk in the door. And I am not the picture of someone who has a drug problem AT ALL. I was on disability during the first few years and I CHOSE to go off of it. I wanted to work. I wanted to be successful and I have pushed myself through every devastating road block that's been put in front of me. I once went to a pain management doctor and the office was filled with addicts.

I just wanted to scream at him because he's obviously supporting the drug habits of so many people yet he won't even give me a second glance for real problems.

In general, the more paperwork you have that takes the burden of responsibility away from the prescribing physician, the more likely he is to approve a painkiller for a patient.",2.596727728843689,1.637658953666687,3.323316097259521,2.4897810220718384,3.065772533416748,1.97357040643692,2.18928325176239,3.345733165740967,1.702338993549347,2.566718816757202,2.987828612327576,2.1174347400665283,3.715148687362671,3.2940878868103027,1.9372170567512512,1.891393482685089,3.3761425018310547,3.362295627593994,3.5759365558624268,3.948886632919312,3.6265735626220703,3.7381067276000977

497,497,2.5,"I think I struggle most with the fact he was dying slowly with heart failure and two years ago he started fainting and I thought he was doomed. But once he was diagnosed and on medication he went back to his old self! It was a miracle. And every six months or so something would happen and we’d have to adjust his meds and then he’d be fine! So I’d been doing heaps of reading on heart failure and I had been trying to plan and prepare for a “good death” and I’d always paid dog sitters when I was away to be with him and I’d sourced his meds cheaper and his whole illness management took quite a toll. I was constantly making sure his quality of life was still okay. 

So when another dog attacked him and I couldn’t stop it I just kept screaming “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” cause this was not the end I wanted for him. He was in shock and we both were covered in his blood but at first the vet was hopeful! I couldn’t believe it. He jugular was exposed and trachea torn but he was still fighting to live! Even with his dodgy heart meaning too risky for a general he was stapled back together and came home briefly. But I knew something was wrong and he couldn’t walk properly or eat and he never again wagged his tail or barked and he was like a zombie dog with his whole “Butchness” gone. He did still try and be close to me even in that terrible daze of the day after the attack. 

Vet said it was maybe medication so lowered the dose but he went into a long seizure snoozing next to me and if I’d had a gun I would have shot him right there cause I finally understood what a loss of quality of life looked like. I think he was brain damaged and was never going to recover. He started leaking brain fluid and I raced him to the vet and asked for him to be put down straight away to stop even one second more of him having to fight. So I got to hold him and be with him as he passed and I’m grateful for that last bit of time at home we had. That little dog had been around longer than any partner in my life, longer than my kid, longer than any house I’d lived in and he was just so,so loyal to me right to the end. 

I feel like people are rushing me to get over it asking about getting another dog or trying to distract me and no one knows how to comfort me. Like there were no flowers and cards and funerals etc. No one rings to check if you need a casserole dropped off. I did get him cremated and his ashes are back home. I ended up at the doctor a mess with flashbacks from the attack and nightmares and doc gave me placebo level of Valium and told me to try CBT online. Ugh. I saw him put diagnosis “grief” in his drop down box but it’s strange how society doesn’t actually make space for the grief of losing a pet. I still had to work, parent, pay bills and cook and I don’t think that helped my mental state. Its been a few days since any flashbacks now and I am sleeping again but now I’m just a bit angry at everyone who assumes I’m over the trauma of the last two weeks.  I still miss Butch every day.","That was a traumatic and horrifying experience for you and a terrible end for Butch. I’m glad you got to hold him as he passed, but I have to say it sounds like the vet should’ve helped him pass directly after the attack instead of patching him up and sending him home. Either way, that was traumatic and horrifying. The stuff of literal nightmares. You must’ve felt so helpless while it was happening and shocked and horrified for days after. I can not imagine the trauma of this. My tiny dog is my life, and she’s very old, and all I want in the world is for her to have an easy death. Nothing would destroy me as completely as an experience like yours. I’m so sorry you haven’t been given the space for grief. There is something holy and pure about grief, and we need to learn to hold a space for that. I’m so sorry you haven’t had that. Sounds like you got steamrolled right back into the grind of daily life.",2.0,3.0,994,1,"I think I struggle most with the fact he was dying slowly with heart failure and two years ago he started fainting and I thought he was doomed. But once he was diagnosed and on medication he went back to his old self! It was a miracle. And every six months or so something would happen and we’d have to adjust his meds and then he’d be fine! So I’d been doing heaps of reading on heart failure and I had been trying to plan and prepare for a “good death” and I’d always paid dog sitters when I was away to be with him and I’d sourced his meds cheaper and his whole illness management took quite a toll. I was constantly making sure his quality of life was still okay. 

So when another dog attacked him and I couldn’t stop it I just kept screaming “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” cause this was not the end I wanted for him. He was in shock and we both were covered in his blood but at first the vet was hopeful! I couldn’t believe it. He jugular was exposed and trachea torn but he was still fighting to live! Even with his dodgy heart meaning too risky for a general he was stapled back together and came home briefly. But I knew something was wrong and he couldn’t walk properly or eat and he never again wagged his tail or barked and he was like a zombie dog with his whole “Butchness” gone. He did still try and be close to me even in that terrible daze of the day after the attack. 

Vet said it was maybe medication so lowered the dose but he went into a long seizure snoozing next to me and if I’d had a gun I would have shot him right there cause I finally understood what a loss of quality of life looked like. I think he was brain damaged and was never going to recover. He started leaking brain fluid and I raced him to the vet and asked for him to be put down straight away to stop even one second more of him having to fight.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched.

I love my Dad, it's always felt like him and I against the world. He pseudo adopted me when he met my mother who has Bipolar disorder along with some heavy narcissism. They broke up around age three, she has been an off and on again mother. My Dad continued to man up and be my father. I remember when we shared a bunk bed at my grandparents house. I found out a 18 over Facebook from my genetic father's girlfriend. It was hard but brought my Dad and I closer, I left for the Navy not too long after. When I was gone I kept pretty close with him. He's continued to be my rock after I got back as I currently live at home with him. I've continually heard how he talks about me when I'm not around and hearing how proud he is.

Is it weird to say I miss when he used to sing me to sleep? He's always wanted me to live my own life and not to influence it, but sometimes I just wish I could hear from him that I'm doing the right thing. I know when I left and came back I changed a lot, dealing with new anxieties and struggles. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but he was my best friend.

Long story short, due to a LOT of complicated issues, many of them health and finance related, I'm unemployed and still live with my mother despite my age, to my great shame, and also unable to drive (though that last bit might change in the near future).  Working on completing college, but otherwise I'm essentially housebound.  Dad, while a bit more openminded than most his age were, passed away just shy of 70 four years ago, and Mom... well, to say she thinks poorly of LGBT folks is like calling an open flame ""significantly warm"".

And even if I had the money and transportation, moving to another city nearby wouldn't change much, because it's Mississippi, a whole state full of similar people for the most part.

Needless to say both my being bisexual and trans are kept so deeply closeted that I've metaphorically stood on the border of Narnia and chucked pebbles at Sir Tumnus' lamp-post...

So I figure it'll be another couple years more before I can truly take my first steps, sadly...  Very disheartening, overall.","I’m very sorry to hear that.  I nearly lost my mom twice in the last 5 years from both alcoholism and cancer, and luckily she pulled through.  Always remember, you’re a woman inside, and regardless of physical transition, and no one can take that away from you.

I live in my in law’s basement, and among other very complicated things (A sudden death in the family, my father in law going off his bipolar meds every other week, my own financial issues from college and being generally broke for my entire adult life) my mother in law is a trump supporter and frequent viewer of Alex Jones, who thinks trans people are demons or cyborgs or the harbingers of the apocalypse.  She doesn’t “know” as in I haven’t told her, but she can totally see my boobs, so I’m sure she is figuring it out.   

It’s so hard to hide at home, and I’m so sorry that you’re more or less stuck there, but it WILL get better.  If you ever need to talk, just message me, I’m an artist so I’m literally always online lol.

522,522,1.0,"I am South African and my family is in the process of moving to Canada. Genocide might be a very strong word for what is happening here, but there is definitely a problem. The violence and growing racial tensions here terrify me, and many others.
What was done in the past is terrible. I know that. I've known that my whole life. But I have lived in fear of the people in this country who want to be violent and then blame those actions on apartheid. I have lost family members to this, and I know many people who have lost even more. Those statistics do not take into account the people who are not on farms but still brutally murdered in their own homes. It does not take into account the people who are brutally attacked but not killed. It doesn't take into account the random acts of senseless violence all over the country, not just in farms.
What is happening here is terrible, but I'm not going to pretend that it's just happening to white people. And honestly, I've seen people say that it is all well deserved, even if you were born after apartheid ended. But I for one am so infinitely grateful that I have the opportunity to get out of here, and I will forever be grateful to the country of Canada for giving us that opportunity.

Genocide might be a very strong word for what is happening here, but there is definitely a problem. The violence and growing racial tensions here terrify me, and many others.
What was done in the past is terrible. I know that. I've known that my whole life. But I have lived in fear of the people in this country who want to be violent and then blame those actions on apartheid. I have lost family members to this, and I know many people who have lost even more. Those statistics do not take into account the people who are not on farms but still brutally murdered in their own homes. It does not take into account the people who are brutally attacked but not killed. It doesn't take into account the random acts of senseless violence all over the country, not just in farms.
What is happening here is terrible, but I'm not going to pretend that it's just happening to white people. And honestly, I've seen people say that it is all well deserved, even if you were born after apartheid ended. But I for one am so infinitely grateful that I have the opportunity to get out of here, and I will forever be grateful to the country of Canada for giving us that opportunity.

I've tried a couple different antidepressants since I last streamed, neither of which helped. I have no health insurance either, so it's been difficult to get in to speak with a specialist who could actually diagnose what the hell is wrong with me.

The Rainbow Bridge Poem;

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old, are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt, or maimed are made whole and strong again. Just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.

The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing. They each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together...but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers.

Suddenly...he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster, and faster.

You have been spotted.

When you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face. Your hands again caress the beloved head. You look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then... you cross the Rainbow Bridge together.

Some days I swear we're two seconds from deciding to divorce.  It's amazing how people change during the course of a relationship.  We're both at fault.  I just keep procrastinating having a serious discussion.,"Sorry to hear that, I've been there a few times with my wife over the years. We've been together 11 and married 6, definitely had a few rough patches where it was like we couldn't even be in the same room together.

Love that you intend to last a lifetime is not an easy thing. All people change whether they want to or not, but talking through the hard times and learning from them can do so much to strengthen a relationship. Those real talks are so hard, but they are necessary. If you just leave feelings to fester, the resentment for each other just grows.

Last night at work, one of my employees, a 64 year old man, came to me around 8:00 pm looking like complete shit. He said his chest hurt, his heart was racing, and he was having trouble breathing. I immediately dropped everything and drove him to the emergency room. He lives about an hour away from work, so I called his wife, informed her of the situation, and told her I’d stay with him until she could get there. She told me she couldn’t drive, and would have to get her daughter to come over and drive her in. No problem, I said, take your time. So I checked him in, and stayed with him while they ran tests. I got a few calls from his wife, apologizing that she couldn’t get a hold of her daughter, and would be longer than anticipated. Again, no problem, take your time.

Cut to almost 1:00am. He’s still there, in serious pain, having spent the last four plus hours being poked, prodded, and XRayed. His wife and daughter finally arrive, and I pull his wife aside to tell her what’s happened, and what we do and don’t know. She’s sweet, and grateful, and obviously a bit scared. The daughter, on the other hand, spends twenty minutes complaining about what a huge inconvenience this is, never once asking how her father is, and even goes so far as to ask why I didn’t drive the hour or so to a hospital closer to her house.

I didn’t do what I did for praise, or thanks. I did it because one of my employees is sick, and it was the right thing to do. I did it because if my dad got sick at work, I hope to god someone would do the same. But for fucks sake, I just spent four hours in The ER with your dad, I think a little fucking gratitude is in order.

I used to believe that I should be the change I wanted to see in the world.  I was kind to everyone, I encouraged everyone I met, I was super positive. 

Thank you for thinking of me.  I do appreciate your thoughts, and you taking the time to respond to me.  I am just very tired.  The results of having been this badly abused by romantic partners leaves me unable to trust.  Without trust a relationship cannot happen.

I admit it, I am scared of women.  I was very good to the ones I dated; I cannot imagine what would happen if I was not good to them.  I would probably be bound while I was sleeping and have my house torched because someone wasn't happy with the relationship.

The risk outweighs the reward.  Romance is a younger man's game.  I am far too old, and love is for people who can have a healthy family.  I am too old for that now.","Hey. Your exhaustion with women and life in general is absolutely palpable in your writing; it filled me with concern.

I used to believe that I should be the change I wanted to see in the world.  I was kind to everyone, I encouraged everyone I met, I was super positive. 

Thank you for thinking of me.  I do appreciate your thoughts, and you taking the time to respond to me.  I am just very tired.  The results of having been this badly abused by romantic partners leaves me unable to trust.  Without trust a relationship cannot happen.

I admit it, I am scared of women.  I was very good to the ones I dated; I cannot imagine what would happen if I was not good to them.  I would probably be bound while I was sleeping and have my house torched because someone wasn't happy with the relationship.

The risk outweighs the reward.  Romance is a younger man's game.  I am far too old, and love is for people who can have a healthy family.  I am too old for that now.",2.6270655393600464,1.7819142937660215,3.222011089324951,2.736348509788513,3.2333197593688965,2.047734498977661,2.6608227491378784,3.4537835121154785,1.7388266921043396,2.642721652984619,3.034459352493286,2.083316206932068,3.86814022064209,3.176676988601685,2.192910671234131,1.7563939690589905,3.331105232238769,3.575310230255127,3.929874420166016,3.752442359924317,1065,0,"Hey.

It’s going to hinder you in life.  I think getting into grad school is the least of your worries right now. If I were in your shoes, I don’t know how I would even be able to concentrate in school. Getting a Bachelors or even a Masters degree is no guarantee you’re going to make it in life or make those big bucks. I don’t mean this to belittle you or the hard work you’ve put into your degree, but the reality is that psychology is one of those majors that a lot of people take because it’s interesting and not because jobs are in demand or pay the big bucks. You have to get a Masters just to land an entry level job. What is going to make you stand out in the job market if you don’t have the freedom to network or gain experience?

I felt horrible and guilty during the whole thing but today I’ve managed to cut myself some slack and realise that I could’ve frozen but instead I managed to do something, even if it was just a bit. 

I was thinking about it today and I don’t know *what possessed me* to see what was happening and instantly run to the door, considering that I didn’t know if the person had a knife or was crazy enough to keep stabbing people. I just didn’t think. But I also didn’t put myself in danger, so I luckily still had common sense. I’d like to think that if I ever see myself in a similar situation I’d do the same. 

I was somehow not *too* panicky, it’s crazy what adrenaline does to you. After the adrenaline wore off I was just really spaced out and emotional.

I definitely recommend a first aid course.

I also recommend putting in the effort and forcing yourself to ""create"" a drive or motivation. It might not immediately overpower the depressing feelings, but you really gotta trick yourself into wanting it until you actually want it.

There is nothing wrong with gaming for escapism but, speaking from personal experience, even just slowly reducing how often you play games down by 1 hour a day will help you.

One thing that helps me in times like this is to take note of the things I most like to do (and are easy to do), and just do them. For me that includes:

* Going out for a walk
* Taking a long hot shower
* Listening through a favourite album

You'll have things that work for you, which may or may not include the above.

They shouldn't be taken as ultimate truth, but you might have heard about the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. They can apply to all kinds of loss, not just death, and everyone experiences them differently, in different combinations and orders and often people only experience some of them.

As I said, they're not ultimate truth, and they're not hard rules, but they are often a useful way of understanding how we respond to loss. It sounds to me like you got the depression first, then moved on to denial, but rather than denying the events have happened you're subconsciously denying that you ever cared, denying that it matters to you.

It actually sounds very similar to how my brain's dealt with important personal relationships ending in the past. It hurt at first, then for a long time I snapped into a state where all the feelings were just 'gone' like you say, it was like I'd never cared about the person at all, but I knew I had. It was just my brain protecting itself until there was enough distance from the events for it to start safely processing shit about it again.

It is good to not bury these things, but sometimes burying them for a time is a perfectly normal part of the process. The fact that you did have a really emotional response in the first place means you didn't just totally bury it in the pit of emotions, and you'll probably start to process it again soon, when distance makes it easier to deal with.

I've been depressed for like the past 4 years and its been a fuckin struggle, especially this past year. Moved to a new town out of my parents house for the first time and honestly i think it made shit worse. Again, this past year has been really shit, kind of culminating with shit going on with this girl I love but it's weird. I have felt broken and lost and I honestly I don't really have a lot of reasons to be alive right now.

But devils hockey has been a nice little break from the emptiness. Despite having absolutely no personal connection to the state of New Jersey, it's always been fun to be a Devils fans even through the ups and downs. Ever since 2012 it's been a wild ride and I'm glad to have experienced it, makes these victories and future successes to come taste that much sweeter. I don't really like talking about my personal shit cause it doesn't feel like anyone really cares but I'm thankful for this subreddit and the shitposting in the game threads and everyone in it you know. I don't really have a lot to live for, but that won't keep me from getting hype for getting rid of 5 long years of frustration

Let's get a fucking win tonight

#FUCK THE RANGERS","FUCK THE RANGERS, FUCK THEIR FUCKING FANS, FUCK THEIR FUCKING SHIT HOLE. FUCK THEM ALL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.

Sports is a great thing. It picks you up and gives you something to hope for. When your team is winning you feel like your winning. No matter what its a great feeling when the team wins. Often when the Devils or the Steelers are winning I feel like anything is possible. 

Its only one step on your journey though. If your feeling the way you and aren’t getting help from a therapist you should. You sound young, let me tell you from an older guy: get on top of this shit now. The bravest and strongest thing you can do is admit you need help understanding your psyche. I didn’t. WhenI I had a complete collapse in my forties I almost lost everything that meant anything and everything i gad worked my whole life for.

Its not going to get better until you treat it for what it is: a chronic disease.

Hopefully you’re already doing it and Im just being a douche telling you the obvious.

Sadly the runt of the litter passed away today.

I still haven’t replied individually but I promise I will. I feel like everything was just a bad dream and to a certain point I’m relieved I woke up and it’s over. At the same time, when I think about going back trying and all the drugs, all I want is to cry my eyes out.

thanks for that information. she wants nothing to do with me now and says she doesent have the need for any man. i was worried there is someone else but then the way she acts with me it does seem like she only wants and needs our daughter. i just wish she would listen to me and go visit a doctor. she has also wanted nothing to do with her 2 year old pug dog. she choosed her and loved her and was so proud to mother her. now she acts like the dog is non existent. and wants nothing t do with it. i dont know if i should just keep letting her push me away and shutting me out. or keep showing her i am a nice guy and i have changed. she refuses to believe i will change into a better man but i really have. all i want to do now is be patient. and wait for her old self to come back to me. she said that might never come back. but i think different. is it possible she will regret leaving me in a few months? i am a good dad and i just felt that me and her was the perfect item even after we use to fight. she chose me to have that baby with. that must mean something. now she says she never pictured us getting married. wel why did we used to talk about it and why plan on our daughter. she just seems to be so angry at me right now",Sorry man. It sounds like a tough time. I can’t say if she’s going to regret breaking up with you- there’s no way to know that. Even those close to you two probably could not say. All you can do is be kind and helpful. It’s good that you’re a good dad. That’s the most important thing because even if you do break up you’ll always be in each other’s lives. You’ll always need to get along and navigate parenting together. All I can say is that there may be a very natural component to all of this. There was with me. And I don’t think prescription drugs would of solved anything. It just took time and patience and some real sleep. Good luck man. Hang in there.,3.0,2.0,1128,1,"

They saw something weird on an abdominal ultrasound and the eventual biopsy revealed melanoma.

She had no signs, symptoms or anything that clearly pointed to having a massive cancerous tumour in her. She's a light skinned person with plenty of moles and freckles. She's pretty sun safe, but apparently not enough.

Turns out one of these was actually bad news and metastisized.

After a few months of treatment, we get to see next week if it's working.

And as a bonus, my baby daughter needs a PET scan to see if she's been exposed to it, as it was there during the pregnancy, and melanoma is one of those rare cancers that can cross the placenta.

It's been a completely shithouse last few months.

Get yourself checked. As bad as it is for you - it's even worse for those around you.","Stay positive, mate. I got cancer when I was a kid. 1986. Six yeas old. It was fucking bad, they didn't have much hope for me (basically told my parents to get ready for a fucking funeral) - but here I am. 

They've made HUGE steps in treatment and imaging. The prognosis is vastly different for almost all cancers, now. There is absolutely hope. Stay cool - the worst thing you can do is panic or give up.

Don't worry about the radioactive dyes, x-rays and so forth. It sounds worse than it is. General anaesthesia is far more dangerous. Radiotherapy, on the other hand, can be nasty.

In time you will grow and see all of this as a period of growth and learning. College can be incredibly mentally and emotionally crushing. I went through a lot of my own growth and difficulty in a time probably around yours, and am now working in my field happily.

In the time where I didn't want to live anymore, where I couldn't even feel anything at all - I had been so grateful and happy in life before and had suddenly lost my sense of purpose and self - I would never say it was a good thing.

Now if you asked me, I wouldn't change that period of my life for the world. It was just a couple of years ago, but with seeking help when I realized I NEEDED it, switching counselors when I knew the one I had wouldn't work, relying on friends I wasn't sure would understand me, but did, and so so much more, I became who I am now.

I want to say that you aren't alone. And in a way, that's a totally bullshit statement. In our personal mental health, and state of mind in the moment, from person to person we are so completely different. But in the end human patterns are just that. We can cope, and grow, and find ways to be happy again, or for the first time, and live grateful of our pain and loss and grievances.

Also, I failed out of a program in university. I switched and am now happy where I'm at, with a newfound sense of appreciation for learning and growth. It feels hopeless and crushing to be failing and in the cycle of anxiety/depression where you can't even get out of bed, and I've been there, but you CAN find out your way to grow out of it.

Being a woman who has been in this exact situation, I can give you some sad news. I did the same thing to my ex. We agreed on a “hall pass” situation. Basically I came up with the idea because there was someone else I wanted to have sex with. I knew I had feelings for someone else, but I didn’t want to dump my boyfriend so this seemed like an easy way to get what I wanted without hurting anyone. Basically, I think your girlfriend is just looking for a way out.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, 2 years later me and the hall pass guy are in the happiest relationship, and I would never consider doing this to him.

I am upset because I don't want another diagnosis.  I don't want something else wrong with me, especially something that you're born with and that never goes away.  I am already so broken; I don't want to be broken even worse.

I'm also upset because I have found at least a dozen problems that I have that are symptoms of autism.  In fact, I can't think of anything wrong with me that isn't a symptom of autism.

I went my whole life being ""different"" from classmates, not understanding why I was the only one that seemed to be not normal and react a certain way to things.

When my sister was in college to become a teacher, she was being trained to recognize the symptoms of kinds on the autism spectrum. She told me when I was 18 than she thought I might have autism. I didn't believe her until I was 22 when friends made similar comments and I started researching autism on my own.

For me it felt wrong at first because I had been socialized to dislike autism. To see it as a flaw. 

It got better though. Most children on the spectrum still learn how to socialize normally, they learn how to recognize emotions, how to empathize and look at the world through the perspectives of others. We learn these things later in life, but we can still learn them.

I'm sorry that I can't just wave a wand and make it all normal, make it feel like there isn't a canyon between us and whatever normal is.

597,597,4.0,"thank you for posting this, this is exactly what i needed at this time. i am 23 y/o female and just started to experience HA (sept 2017 had a panic attack and ended up in ER) and unfortunately it has taken over my happiness in some shape or form. 

i think it’s interesting that you mentioned that you lost someone at a very young age and that is the reason you have it — i lost both my mom and dad suddenly to heart attacks. i am going to read the book you recommended.

one question i have for you is — i have been trying to exercise but my HA starts flaring up if i am sore or when i am doing cardio... i feel like something is wrong and immediately start to have a panic attack(i am able to stop them, but i am working very hard to *prevent* them from happening)

overall again — thank you so much for this post.. it gives me hope. ❤️","Sorry for your loss. That must be very hard. 

I know what you mean about exercise and soreness. My abdomen has been sore in the same spot for a few months now. I've had tests and scans but you know how it is...they could have missed something. Both a paranoid thought and unfortunately could be true too.

I tried exercising the other day and made my abdomen worse it seems. Maybe that means it's just a muscle strain!

Anyways I really feel like HA at it's root, for me, is about accepting. Accepting suffering. Accepting death. Worrying can't prevent either. You can't escape it. But do you really want to spend your time worrying? No matter how much time we have or what suffering is ahead, why not enjoy the moments we can enjoy. The moments without pain. The moments we are relatively healthy. Soak them up. Live them. Don't waste them worrying *before* the actual worrying is granted. 

Hope you can find some peace.

Because of that, and this is way before what he did to me, I knew I could never ever say anything without getting fucking crucified by these fucking psycho fans. He did a really good job of being the person to look up to and to trust, which is why no one would ever believe this. He took advantage of me when I was at the lowest point of my life, he knew exactly what he was doing. It was calculated.

I hate that he killed himself, even with all of this, I never ever would be okay with that, it's a terrible thing that happened, and I wish he never did that, but I cannot be okay with the sexual assault that happened to me when I repeatedly said NO, and he waited until I passed out. So, anyone who refuses to believe this, that's your thing, but this happened, and I am not the only person, which is now obvious because of the Jane Doe thing. I just want you all to know that we were forced into silence for 5 years, because of this fucking crazy fans of CA who refuse to believe anything bad about them, including some of their own producers. I reached out to one of the women who released this google doc to anonymously say something about this, and I was ignored. She knew about it and did nothing. So, I'm glad that CA did this, even if it wasn't intentional. I have closure, in a way, kinda. After all this time.

Don't beat yourself up over a slow recovery - accept and appreciate the time you dedicate to getting yourself figured out again. Set yourself a year to heal and some goals as to what that healing means. Talk to someone . Encourage wholesome relationships. Try to spend as much time outside your head as you do inside (too much introspection is a recipe for neurosis, though it's great in moderation). Never disparage yourself for failing to be as healed as others expect or demand. Be comfortable with your own pace. Once the year is up, make a new plan from that point.

I really think Agape could connect with you--just not on a ""Jesus"" level. I'm sorry you've been going through this. It really sucks. No one deserves it. Even the asshole down below who told you to leave town.  PM if you want to get things off your chest. I myself am too cosnumed by my own issues--have a hard time helping myself...and have a hard time functioning and finding time (and motivation) for things so, I might be a shitty shoulder to lean on.  Hold on to whatever good things you have, or make new things, like the volunteering idea, or join an affinity group for something you enjoy (board games...?)... but, I really suggest you consider visiting Agape (check out their web presence first--oh, their 'leader' has a great radio show on KPFK on fridays, if it's still on. Check out kpfk's site for archived shows).  **and please keep away from any 'exorcists'.

I actually really like my major and Spanish it’s interesting to me and I’ve always wanted to learn lots of other languages, but for some reason when it comes down to going to class and doing the homework it’s just not something I want to do/when I have to do it I just get so upset I feel like I’m going to explode.

628,628,1.5,"Well, I missed last week. Things have not been great in 0rganic Land. My grandmother passed away last Sunday. She had been sick for a while, the dementia had kicked in around 2009 and had been getting steadily worse since. We had caretakers with her for the last six-seven years because she needed someone with her 24 hours and unfortunately she had been become very mean and aggressive in the last two or three years, and it drudged up some personal stuff for mom and she couldn't handle it sometimes, so she couldn't live with us. So we went down there Sunday and got her out of the house. My mom drove down first and I followed her down after an hour or two, and she was just in no state to drive back home, so by the time we even got home it was midnight but neither of us could sleep. I watched Spirited Away and cried like an asshole when the train left the bath house and during the visit to Zenibaba's house. I did all the driving for my mom the next day, who was a wreck because she had a migraine on top of four hours of sleep, and we had to meet my scumbag uncle at the funeral home to discuss all the stuff you discuss when a person dies. I basically plied my mom with soup and tea for most of the night until she finally fell asleep, and she was better the next day. Thankfully I have some of the greatest friends on the fucking planet, and one of them drove me down to my grandmother's house the next day so I could get my car (left if there when I picked up my mom) even though it's an hour away. 

My sister flew in and I picked her up from the airport, and then we got slammed with a northeaster, so we couldn't have the funeral until Friday (which the church almost fucked up by scheduling the wrong date). My two uncles and their annoying kids who never visited my grandmother (their mother) more than once a year if that and who never helped my mom with anything, money, moving stuff, finding care for my grandmother, never even called her to see how she was doing, nothing, all showed up, and I just wanted to tell them to go away. They didn't give a shit about her while she was alive. Some family friends of mine and my mom's showed up, though, even my best friend's parents (he's moved away) to the funeral and our neighbors, and they made the whole thing bearable. My mom was a goddamn mess again, just crying through the burial. It was awful, honestly, there's no beating around the bush. She spent the last nine years taking care of her mother knowing it was going to end like this. She even got sick at the luncheon afterwards, during which we surrounded ourselves with our family friends and kept the family at the other side of the table. One of my uncles barely talked to me or my sister the entire day, and when he tried to walk out without saying bye I purposely grabbed him and said bye just to fuck with him. None of them thanked my mom for handling the arrangments, or for paying for the funeral, or for paying for the luncheon, and they fucking stiffed us for their drink bill at the end. They're assholes one and all and I'm glad I don't have to see them again. 

I got my mom home and she was sick as hell again, not eating, so I cooked shitty soup for her and made sure she ate until she fell asleep. Thankfully she was feeling better by the next morning. Drove my sister back to the airport Sunday, and we started the slow process of cleaning my grandmother's house out. I'm still exhausted, honestly. By Sunday I felt like someone had kicked the shit out of me between the lack of sleep and emotional fatigue. My mother and grandmother basically raised me when I was younger, and even though she was so out of by the end it still sucks that she's gone. The caretakers said she was calling for me, my sister and mother at night during the last week, but not in a sad way, it was like we were little kids again, telling us to get ready to go to the park or the pool. I feel like hell, but I'm happy she's not suffering and angry anymore, even if she's dead. I just want it to be Thursday so I can go to happy hour with my friends, have a couple beers and sort of get back to normal. I've got a lot of thinking to do about my own problems, which this death has cast into stark relief. I've just playing games in my spare time, it's the only thing I can seem to focus on right now, so if you've made it this far and have any cool recommendations throw them my way. Peace out.","Losing a loved one is always tough. I imagine it's even harder when they're as close as your grandmother seemed to be. It's good that you're managing to stay strong though. I imagine your mother will thank you for it, especially considering how shitty the rest of your family was acting.

*A long, long time ago…* I was responsible for the total loss of 6 vehicles in just a span of three years.  Horrific accidents were caused by me and very beautiful vehicles were destroyed!  I had ptsd and I straight up stopped driving when I was around twenty years old.  I rode my bicycle and bummed rides for a solid three, maybe four years.  Since then, a few things have changed for the better and a few years ago I actually bought myself a new car with all the gadgets and gizmos I always wanted in a vehicle and actually a few months ago I paid it off.  A new car to me a decade ago would be the coolest car in the junkyard a year later so this accomplishment has meant a lot to me and I'm incredibly proud of myself for finally developing this level of responsibility.

A few thoughts on the rest of your comment… I've hung around questionable folk and even normal-looking acquaintances and I just want to say for anyone that will listen: if you don't know then, wear a condom.  If you do know them, wear a condom.  Don’t make tear up, just protect yourself.  Also, I agree with your path; I do what I can to pay back loans and what I owe to other people and it makes me feel good.

If I could say anything to a younger me, I'd say - don't rush it and don't go in there in a state.  I think I unnecessarily made it harder just by not understanding myself - refusing to understand myself.  You can't take anything back in life.  The best you can do now is try and make things better for yourself, not worse.  Take a deep breath, brush it off, and learn from your disease.

Need a satisfying, well-paying job?  Don't rush it.  I claimed crappy jobs that I thought were cool when I was manic but could not handle whatsoever while I was depressed.  I work in a office with opportunities in a lab and it works incredibly well with my disorder.  Decent relationship?  I rushed every relationship, but that's just me.

Then my ex-wife calls me screaming, telling me I have to call our daughter's orthopaedic surgeon because his office called to give a budget quote for her surgery. Okay.

*My daughter had surgery when she was 3yo to correct a birth defect on her hips. It's a rare condition, just a few doctors in the country do this surgery. Now one of her legs is a couple of inches smaller and has a couple more issues. The surgery wasn't covered by the health insurance and was expensive AF. She now needs to level both legs and correct another deformity she has developed on her hips*

So, I called the doctor, he explained the surgery to me for the Nth time (it'd be in a month or so) and I KNEW it would be REALLY expensive because he wasn't getting to the point quickly. And then he threw the bomb: the cost is equivalent to 24 times the minimum wage. Not even our car is valued at that. 

My mood had already took a hit when I messaged my ex-wife to tell her because I know how desperate she gets, so I knew what to expect as I reaction.  I explained the surgeries and after telling her how much it costs, I was drowned with a flood of insults, how much worthless I am, how much I am not worth anything..you get the idea. 

I mean, I am unemployed surviving on random freelance jobs, so she isn't totally wrong I could be helping more. But it's so dumb to think I'm don't care and I'm being lazy just because it was EASY for her. She left college already employed and now she's jumping from job to better-job and now works on the best private school in city, earning a VERY good salary. It ain't that easy for everybody, she's blessed to be in a situation like that but thinks fucking everybody should be. She's never had to keep sending resumes or asking around for jobs. She doesn't know that. She does't know what struggling is. Her family has properties around the city, so if there's any issue, they have Backup plans A, B and C. Not me, I am basically fucked if it gets any worse. She can't fucking understand that. 

I am still processing it all. My mood has taken quite a big hit with this situation. Very tough shit to handle. 
","My man. That shit is rough. I recently went through something similar. My ex flew in from vacation with the kids. Didnt remember to book a ride from the airport with car seats. 


I was at the movies, phone off. She called once, then apparently thought her whole family should call me. I walked out of the movie to 20 different text messages and voicemails from her parents, sisters, etc. All about how I am so selfish and worthless that I wouldn't pick them up at the airport. #1, my phone was off. #2 we are 99% no contact due to shit like this. The last time I told her I wouldn't agree to a severe change in our schedule, when threatened to file a restraining order because it would ""just be easier to get what I want"". Which is also why I will now only exchange the kids with her at a police station.

But still... that shit gets in your head. You start to think ""am i worthless? Am i selfish?"". The answer is no. But it takes a lot of self-care to come around to that. It gets easier though. Just remember that you cannot out-argue or out-logic crazy, and trying to do so will only make you look crazier. 

I am sorry to hear about your daughter, but it sounds like you love her very much... in doing that and being there for her as a dad, that is the best job you can do. 

Also... one day I am going to croak, probably before my ex. So I keep a journal for a lot of different reasons. First because i hope that one day my kids can know me as a person, not just dad. But a secret hope is that all the crazy shit the ex says will be seen. 

I had a similar experience with my parents, mom saying a bunch of things that just weren't true. But who was I to NOT believe her. My dad had already passed. Then I found his journals in an old box a few years later.  Let's just say it was quite enlightening and cleared up a lot of confusion I had about my parents relationship. 

If you chose to do something similar, just dont turn it into a bitch fest focused on trying to prove yourself right/worthy/better than. Just describe how you feel similar to what you have now. What are your fears if the surgery doesnt happen? How will it effect your daughters quality of life? Just ask and write from a place of love. It will help heal you, and maybe one day help heal her perceptions too

The people I told about this, the very few, they knew I would not and could not lie about something like this. Because jane Doe did try to speak about it before, she told a fan site, she was then called a troll and ""that's like accusing a puppy of murder"".

He did a really good job of being the person to look up to and to trust, which is why no one would ever believe this. He took advantage of me when I was at the lowest point of my life, he knew exactly what he was doing. It was calculated. Then, he shot himself, and I (and the others) knew we could never ever talk about this, because he's not here anymore, and his widow could even sue us if she wanted. He has an elderly mother, and the thought of her knowing what happened made my heart break, so I kept silent.

I had to blacklist anything related to him on my twitter. Seeing his photo makes me sick.

652,652,1.5,"Good evening Ari. If you could give me your advice I would really appreciate it, the matter means a lot to me. I was married to a Jewish girl who divorced me and married a Hasidic Jew. Worst part is that my daughter lives with them and my ex is raising her in a strict tradition - the costumes, kosher only food, Jewish kindergarten, changed her name and now she wants her to go to a Jewish school where teachers only speak Hebrew and when I approached the school they plain and simple refused to answer my questions. She is six now and I've seen her doing things that just break my heart. She would tell me that I'm not her family since I'm not Jewish, she had hysterical breakdown when I took her for a drive on Saturday, she would barely want to talk to me, she tells me nonsense about Greeks being mages back in the day etc... It's pretty hard to look at. I can't take any legal action since she lives in a different country and the only recourse I have is that I can talk to her. 
What would you think, what kind of questions would make her realize what a sect that really is? To make her see not only positives but also limitations put on her? I still hope I will be able to bring her to US and send her to college, I have some leverage with my ex... But my little girl must want that too instead of just marrying a Hasidic Jew, putting on a wig and spend her time looking after children...","I'm so sorry this happened to you and your daughter. It's sad, but not necessarily the end of it. Quite often, the kids in situations like this end up realizing what was done to their parents and start questioning things.

Now, if you want specific advice on how to handle it, I may not be the right person for it as I was never in your shoes. But, I can tell you that Hasidic folks don't change because of outside pressure. I suggest you ask questions with her, get her to be the one asking questions from you. Hasidic Judaism isn't really good at answering questions, fill that gap, make sure she knows that you'd answer them.

657,657,1.5,"My Dad passed away on April 11 unexpectedly, and it's been pretty horrible.  It really has changed the whole experience for me, and I'm struggling.

In the end, I am pushing forward with things as planned.  But I can't lie and say I haven't had some really terrible moments.  Taking my Dad's name off of the guest list, the rehearsal dinner, having his name on the invites that were ordered well in advance assuming he would be here...it's been crushing.

Aside from losing my Dad, my Mom won't be able to afford to live on her own and I'm the only one here with her.  I take care of her the most, and she'll likely be moving into a house with us once we can look for one after the wedding.  My brother and his gf also got into a car accident on the way home from my bridal shower, our rehearsal dinner had to be cancelled because our officiant suddenly can't make it...there have been so many other things!  So there's grief and financial stress, the stress of the wedding itself - and the impact of being newlyweds taking in my mother.

I go to therapy and I talk there a lot.  My fiancé is my sounding board, as are a couple of friends.  It is not easy - and you just need to listen to your gut and do what feels right.  I admit I've felt not just sad - but angry, resentful, and jealous of the many people I know who had the wedding and wedding related events they wanted, with everyone they know and love present.  I'm fairly angry at the world right now.

I'm very sorry that you're enduring this though.  I already hadn't been enjoying wedding planning, and this all made it much harder.  At the end of the day, I would have done all of this A LOT differently!  But i couldn't have known all of that up front.

Lots of people talk about cancelling, but it wasn't a real possibility for us.  We'd lose money on all of the deposits (we're paying ourselves), and we are already financially stretched thin as it is. I'm sure people will have suggested that to you.  If it's something you can or want to consider - do!  But it just wasn't real option for us, and not one I wanted to even consider.  And there's a Six Feet Under episode where a character loses her pregnancy the day before the wedding and was a wreck, but she felt that the only thing worse than going through it would be to have to go through cancelling everything.  And that's how I've felt.

What I'm trying to do is focus on the fact that I'm marrying someone I love.  I am lucky for that.  I'm also happy to know that my Dad knew and approved of my fiancé.  

I've just felt timing wasn't on my side this year - at all.  I feel you!  If you want to message me, please do.  I'm happy to talk or just listen.  You need to be able to vent and feel supported.  I haven't felt very supported other than my fiancé - and that's a lot for him alone to handle.  Take care of yourself!","I'm so sorry for your loss. So much of what you've shared are exactly the things I think about when I consider my dad being gone, including worrying over what will happen to my mom. I am so sorry you are going through so much. I feel so much of what you've written so hard. I hope that therapy and love carry you through and you have a beautiful-if-bittersweet day that honors your love for your partner, your dad, and everyone else you hold dear. 

We don't have to decide whether to cancel because we haven't really even started. All we have is a rough guest list, rough total budget number, and a very early search of venues.

663,663,1.0,"Bowie was only 5 years old when he passed away today. Over the last year, I’ve taken him to countless vets, including two internal medicine specialists, and no one could figure out why his lab results were coming back so poorly. 

Today, I woke up to him constantly shaking and losing his balance. He wouldn’t eat any of his favorite treats, and I decided to let him go. The vet said she could try to hospitalize him, but she didn’t expect him to recover since his body temperature was 10 degrees lower than what was normal. 

I miss him terribly, but I’m glad that he is no longer in pain. And even though he could barely walk this morning, he still mustered enough energy to curl up next to me while I got ready. He used to sleep right next to my pillow, and my bed feels a lot emptier without him.

I lost a 3.5 year old, Grey Goose, who was sick from the time I adopted him, when he was 2. He was on steroids all the time. Our vet theorized that he had bartonella, which isn’t uncommon in shelter cats, because they get fleas often. He was always getting a kitty cold and his mouth would be inflamed and he wouldn’t eat. 

One day, I woke up to him crying downstairs. He couldn’t move his back legs. I rushed him to the vet. He had a blood clot called a saddle thrombosis and only 50% of cats ever recover movement. She did x-rays and it turned out, he had another clot in his heart. She gave him clot busters and told us to take him home, and if in 24 hours he still wasn’t moving, he likely wouldn’t move and that heart clot was a ticking time bomb. My husband and I stayed up all night, crying and petting him and trying to make him eat, but it was clear that morning that it was time. It was so horrible. I was pregnant and we were so looking forward to our baby and Goose being best friends.

If you’re able to establish a positive relationship at a distance, that would make it much easier to progressively move towards a closer relationship.

But you must not end things like this, for both your sakes. Your thoughts of her must be incredibly confused by both love and pain. If you need to end the relationship, do so on a positive note, with a gesture that recognizes the best in one another.

Perhaps you could have a relationship through email?

If you’re able to establish a positive relationship at a distance, that would make it much easier to progressively move towards a closer relationship.

But you must not end things like this, for both your sakes. Your thoughts of her must be incredibly confused by both love and pain. If you need to end the relationship, do so on a positive note, with a gesture that recognizes the best in one another.

Cutting yourself off from your mom like this also cuts you off from your childhood. Fond memories of childhood can be a great source of mental nourishment, and a way to temper and escape the cruelty of the present and future. It would be hard to divorce your memory of your childhood from your memory of our mother, or to separate your memory of your mother from your current feelings and last encounter.

Only you can decide if a continuing relationship is worth pursuing, but I strongly urge you to give yourself the gift of a better final memory of your mother if you do end the relationship.",2.6851943731307983,1.9251683354377749,3.267577171325684,2.5054948329925537,3.116581439971924,1.9491754174232483,2.0419660806655884,3.35711669921875,2.0089179277420044,2.62019419670105,3.021522045135498,2.177640438079834,3.720384359359741,3.450112819671631,2.146919369697571,1.8550015091896055,3.3252618312835693,3.4052734375,3.912228584289551,3.7790544033050537,3.8844010829925537,4.095005989074707

Speak to a dentist (or a receptionist at the dentist) with their own practice, i.e., not Gentle Dental, My Dentist, or other chains like that. In my experience, most dentists care a lot about people’s dental health and will work with a patient without insurance to either make up a payment plan or perform work at a reduced rate than what they charge patients with insurance. 

You might have to call or visit a few dentist offices to find someone to help you out. It sucks that this even has to be a thing, but dental health is a lot more important than people give it credit for.

683,683,1.5,"Wow. Amazed to see someone posting about me here. I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark on what's been going on with me. It's just that I've reached a point where I can't stand talking about my mental health issues on social media anymore. Yes, as you guessed, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety... again. I've tried a couple different antidepressants since I last streamed, neither of which helped. I have no health insurance either, so it's been difficult to get in to speak with a specialist who could actually diagnose what the hell is wrong with me.

It's only been until very recently that I've started to prepare for a return to streaming, too. Before that I'd convinced myself that I'd blown it for the last time and was trying to figure out how I could make a living that didn't involve streaming at all. I no longer feel a fondness for streaming like I once did. It's not as fun as it once was. I no longer know where I stand with anyone in the Twitch community. So many people I considered friends hardly talk to me at all anymore, social media or otherwise. It's like I was just a stepping stone for these people, and now that they've soaked up all the numbers they can get from me, they've moved on. I know I shouldn't let it get to me, because, hey, that's life. But what can I say? I'm sensitive. 

I could go on listing the myriad of reasons why I haven't been streaming, but suffice it to say... I'm trying. Trying to break through this mental barrier that keeps me from hitting that ""Start Streaming"" button. To all my supporters, I'm so sorry I've been away so long. You deserve better.","Man,

Don't apologize; You don't owe us anything. We're around because you're one hell of an entertainer. To all the people bitching and moaning? Fuck em. There are still plenty of people who support you and are awaiting your return. You didn't blow it, we'll be here. So, take your time and get yourself better. That's the most important thing after all. Thank you for all the entertainment and amazing content over the years. Thank you for being so genuine and actually giving a fuck.

The little shit dropped me as a patient and now I can't seem to find a doctor who is willing to prescribe it, I lost my fucking job, my car, was homeless for a while even, and can barely function and my doctors just keep throwing ssris at me which seem to do absolutely nothing.

If I had money I'd just buy speed and self medicate but that gets me in trouble cause it's an illicit drug and drugs are bad. But I'd rather be dependent on illicit drugs and functional than how I am now.

Anyways sorry for the rant","I’m very very sorry to hear that you are in such a shitty situation. It took me a long time to convince anybody that a stimulant was what I needed because it seems obtuse to people who don’t understand what it’s like to be off balance.

That being said, speed is a lot different than prescribed stimulants, and even vyvanse can be addictive, despite what the label says. 

Don’t get me wrong, I self medicate with alcohol and cigarettes every day and I’m in shitty shape mentally and physically because of it. But I don’t believe we have to be this way.

Been wanting to reply to them, but I don’t know how to bring it up or explain myself so I just say nothing.

And it’s not just as easy as “I’m sick right now, please don’t contact me for an unspecified amount of time or ask what’s wrong”. Sometimes you’re just not ready to open that can of worms, particularly if you’re going through an episode of poor mental health.

It might be worth a try to steer the convo away from things like telling him he needs to stop lying/making promises and instead ask him about why he's lying to you rather than simply telling you the truth.

Peel back the layers of the onion.  Yes, him making and breaking promises to you is terrible and I get you wanting him to stop doing that to you.

WHY is he doing that though?  That's what you should ask him.  I mean, his actions are saying loud and clear that he doesn't want to have sex even though he's saying let's do it tomorrow morning, then he puts it off to later that afternoon, then to the next day etc.

His words ring hollow as you know all too well.

Tell him that his actions do not line up with his words and that you want actions and that you no longer want him to lie to you.

Tell him that if he doesn't want to have sex to say that.  Instead, he's trying to pacify you by saying ""sure honey, we'll have sex tomorrow"".  He knows he won't have sex with you tomorrow but he's trying to make you feel better right then by telling you that and he's putting off dealing with it then.  Then when tomorrow comes, he puts it off yet again.

Why does he keep doing this?  Because it's working for him.  He isn't having sex by doing this, saying these things.  

&amp;#x200B;

That's a cycle I'd have to break.  I'd be like ""honey, don't tell me we'll have sex in the a.m. and then when the a.m. comes you tell me to wait until the afternoon and then when the afternoon comes you tell me to wait until tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and you don't and you tell me we have to take a rain check.""

2) Love doesn't solve all problems. It makes you more motivated to find solutions, but it's not a solution in and of itself. He's got to get a new outlook that isn't ""oh look, a miraculous solution to our significant problems fell from the sky and landed in my lap!"" He can certainly steer his ship in a better direction if he wants to, but he needs to start wanting to. In no way do your feelings and fears right now mean the relationship *has* to end. Scrub that out of your head, because I sincerely doubt you're at the point of no return right this second. 

3) I think you should consider some couples counseling, or if that's not in the budget then committing to working through some of the couple's relationship-building books and worksheets that are free on the internet or cheap at the bookstore.

I'm scared of losing my identity as a person and just becoming Offspring's Mom and not the scientist/runner/scuba diver/hockey fan I am. I'm scared I'll be left all the responsibility of a kid and he'll be a traditional ""parachute dad"". So we talked about it. Over and over and over. He said he expects to be an equal dad, and he shows that now by being an equal member of the household with chores and bills and the emotional labour. He said he loves me not just for my body but for the dedication I put in, and he shows that by asking about my new lifting records and making a silly sign when I run a race. What it boils down to is he pairs words with actions. And that's why I've come around to raising a child with this man. 

You've said that you're afraid your fiancé doesn't have the motivation. That's fair, he might or he might not right now.

During our separation and divorce, I made it clear to my ex that I was going to have full joint custody of our son, and if she disagreed I'd do everything I could to get full custody for myself. We share full joint custody.

I will say to all the fathers out there, yes it's rough, but if you die you have zero chance at being there for your kids. Many will realize in time the truth, sure some will be poisoned against you, but you need to survive even if it's to know their lives and to be there if they ever need you whether they realize it or not, you do. If you can't be in the light, then stay in the shadows, watching over them, keeping them safe.

If you die, they lose and you lose.  During my darkest hours, my thoughts about my son was my only hope left, he's the reason I'm still here. Use that thought to keep you alive when there's nothing else left.

Stay strong, stay alive, yourself and your kids.

727,727,1.0,I'm struggling with missing it. My SO &amp; I met at a bar and bonded over our huge love for craft beers. That was 7.5 years ago. I drank until my blood pressure was wavering between 150/90 and would top out around 195/115 after a weekend bender (so I can relate with the heart trouble thing too). I *had* to stop. He still drinks and enjoys craft beers. I know he cares more about me being alive and healthy than anything but sometimes I'm pretty sure he misses his drinking buddy too. I definitely miss that camaraderie we shared over beer. IDK where I'm going with this .  .  . Any tips or ideas how I might get over it?,"It is a totally legitimate feeling of loss and I commiserate.  When you socialized with alcohol - especially with your mate - it is difficult to decouple the behavior.  I think it is important to acknowledge that — your difficulty in doing this is expected and your triumph is noteworthy (and any possible relapse is also something not to beat yourself up about).  
  
You could *try* to sample the craft beer for taste, but that could lead to feelings of loss, his feeling of sadness at your not joining, etc.  'Controlled limited exposure' is something many non-drinkers think they can manage and usually ends in disaster.  It may work though.  (I thought I'd need to do it this way - to drink 'just a bit' as a former connoisseur I just *had* to keep it in my life.  Turns out, as I ventured down the path of not drinking, I didn't need the taste any longer.)   
  
If you prefer to stay away as I did, it might be important to find a different activity that you can both do together with paralleled camaraderie.  It could be social with others or just the two of you - the point is it needs to be an experience where you can have fun and enjoy each other and build memorable times.  If you can do that you may find you think less and less of those drinking times.

When you socialized with alcohol - especially with your mate - it is difficult to decouple the behavior.  I think it is important to acknowledge that — your difficulty in doing this is expected and your triumph is noteworthy (and any possible relapse is also something not to beat yourself up about).  
  
You could *try* to sample the craft beer for taste, but that could lead to feelings of loss, his feeling of sadness at your not joining, etc.  'Controlled limited exposure' is something many non-drinkers think they can manage and usually ends in disaster.  It may work though.  (I thought I'd need to do it this way - to drink 'just a bit' as a former connoisseur I just *had* to keep it in my life.  Turns out, as I ventured down the path of not drinking, I didn't need the taste any longer.)   
  
If you prefer to stay away as I did, it might be important to find a different activity that you can both do together with paralleled camaraderie.  It could be social with others or just the two of you - the point is it needs to be an experience where you can have fun and enjoy each other and build memorable times.  If you can do that you may find you think less and less of those drinking times.

733,733,1.0,"So today marks the 12th anniversary of my mother's death. It's always hard but this one feels even worse. I think it's due to this summer being the loneliest one yet. I've only went outside to do something twice in the last two months and only one of those times I wasn't alone.

Atop of that I'm thinking of dropping out of college, it's gonna start in a month but I've hated every minute of me being there the past year. I haven't really talked to anyone outside of class for the whole year and just feel so alien.

I don't know what to do however, I have to have a job or be in education to be able to live where I do or else I'll get kicked out and I'm running out of time. 

I hate this. I just hate my life. Why am I myself? Why can't I just be social or something? Is there something wrong with me? I can talk just fine with people but can't ever make a connection with anyone. Don't they want to be friends? Why can't I just be someone who enjoys going out, partying and living? Why is the only thing I even remotely enjoy laying in bed and looking at memes all day? I just want to be normal. I sometimes wish I was never born to begin with.","First off, while it'll do you no good... sorry to hear that you lost your mother...

Hey, at least you made it further than me, I dropped out after half a year, also because I just couldn't handle the social... situation, or environment or whatever you would call it. Alien... is a good word to describe how I felt

&gt;Why can't I just be social or something?

I don't know your history, but I'm pretty convinced these things are very often the cause of ... whatever happened in your past. For myself, I've been socially shit for as long as I can remember, first years of school I already started getting the first signs of being bullied, by primary school, I just was, up to and including the last year of high school. To me, that shows it's partially how I was born, you, I, we're all just the product of the chemicals in our brains, unless you believe in a soul, that's all there's to it... And as such, there's a million and one ways in which we differ, and a million and one ways where imbalances can fuck shit up.

Regardless, bullying for that length of time, will leave it's marks. I too hated life, more than anything, without exaggeration there were years where I would not go a week, without laying in bed, crying to myself unable to think of anything else but how ... peaceful it would be to die, how it'd make all the pain and anguish go away.

After I quit school... things got better, and so... Please, PLEASE, do not give up all hope, the switch from school to work is huge, bigger than high school to uni... It's no heaven, there's all kinds of new shit to deal with, but in regards to humans... it gets better I think. I could never have imagined how different life would become, and change is slow... but, before you know it... you might look around you and think ""huh... I guess life's not the worst"".

I can't give answers to your other questions, hell, I clearly haven't figured half the shit out myself... but don't kid yourself into thinking the other people you see are normal... If I've learned something the last few years, it's that you have NO IDEA how many of the people you think are ""normal"" are dealing with sooo much things...

Fuck it, I'll try and be brief: I was sexually assaulted and when I went to see a university therapist about it, she told me that it was entirely my fault because men are conditioned to think women are lying when they say no, that men lose control and it's up to women to prevent that from happening, that men are more likely to rape women they don't respect (because the guy knew I'd had casual sex before so therefore he was justified in thinking he could take it from me), and then chastised me for not practicing safe sex even though I was NOT AWAKE when he went inside of me. That's not even all of it but those are the main things that have stuck with me years later. 

When I complained to the university about it they told me it was ""a misunderstanding"" and refused to provide me with another therapist, and even the university priest I eventually sought out pointed to the therapist's seniority as if well respected people must be right in whatever they do. I tried to find an off campus therapist but the waiting lists were too long, and all the woman on the hotline I called did was mutter ""be more alert next time, ok?""

Better off Im sure, but I dunno what happened","I just want to say I'm sorry and I empathize because I've had similar things happen to me. It's really hard when you were very certain you had a friend and then some weird sexual stuff comes out of left field and they won't talk about it or cut you out when you reject it. I've had friendships make it through things like this if they were willing to talk about it like adults and drop it, but some won't and those are the ones you don't need. Ones who think maybe the Harry met Sally thing of ""we've been friends forever and then suddenly we simultaneously had sex feelings"" thing happened, but then when it's not reciprocated they turn to dicks? Those ones suck and I know that hurts and you shouldn't feel about about wanting to not be friends. 

If you really value the friendship and talking to him wouldn't be really awful (I 100% understand if it is and you're done; I can't tell from your description if what he said was irreparably damaging), I would try telling him how that made you feel. For some reason he thought secret ""sexy"" pictures to him would make you feel better about your body. And that's crazy. But it also seems like something that a lot of men are conditioned to think: ""Oh she doesn't feel good. If a man thinks she looks good then she'll feel good again"". Which is his responsibility to notice and fix. But maybe if you point it out and he's not a dick, he will fix it. As I said, 100% up to you and there's nothing wrong with cutting someone out who made you feel super hurt. Misogyny sucks. And losing male friends because of stuff like this also sucks.

It's really hard when you were very certain you had a friend and then some weird sexual stuff comes out of left field and they won't talk about it or cut you out when you reject it. I've had friendships make it through things like this if they were willing to talk about it like adults and drop it, but some won't and those are the ones you don't need. Ones who think maybe the Harry met Sally thing of ""we've been friends forever and then suddenly we simultaneously had sex feelings"" thing happened, but then when it's not reciprocated they turn to dicks? Those ones suck and I know that hurts and you shouldn't feel about about wanting to not be friends. 

If you really value the friendship and talking to him wouldn't be really awful (I 100% understand if it is and you're done; I can't tell from your description if what he said was irreparably damaging), I would try telling him how that made you feel. For some reason he thought secret ""sexy"" pictures to him would make you feel better about your body. And that's crazy. But it also seems like something that a lot of men are conditioned to think: ""Oh she doesn't feel good. If a man thinks she looks good then she'll feel good again"". Which is his responsibility to notice and fix. But maybe if you point it out and he's not a dick, he will fix it. As I said, 100% up to you and there's nothing wrong with cutting someone out who made you feel super hurt. Misogyny sucks. And losing male friends because of stuff like this also sucks. 

Edit: Oh wow apparently I'm ramble-y wine-drunk. TLDR: This sucks and I may have suggestions for how to talk to that person.

758,758,1.0,"TW: talk of other people’s pregnancies (and a bloody long post).

So yesterday/today was/is a hard day. 

My oldest/closest school friends and I have a whatsapp group that we talk throughout the day on. 
One of my friends who started the TTC game with me who I shared the rollercoaster of emotions with, became pregnant but had been pretending to not be (refer to previous post about the associated drama/shenanigans)...and so since then our DAILY conversation has been about her pending baby. Anyway yesterday it was this lengthy talk about how she wants a specially crocheted blanket for her baby and wishes one of her friends to gift her baby with it (she knows I crochet blankets for friends babies) so it was very much *hint hint.*
Maybe it’s me, but she knows how hard TTC has been for me so far, we talked daily about our struggles and fears and I don’t understand why she isn’t being a little more sensitive. 

Then on top of that, one of the WAGs who can’t help but go on about her fertile she is and how both her daughters were born on the first sex...she has always been very forthcoming/opinionated about natural birth and breastfeeding and no screens and cloth diapers, like the list of opinions is endless. She often makes other WAG mothers feel crap, from what they’ve told me. Anyway she gave birth 4 months ago and has now become a wellness mum instagrammer and is giving out “inspiration tips” on how to be like her. 
I can’t explain why it rubbed me up the wrong way but it’s the realisation that people around me are having babies and looking/feeling great and I’m here still POAS, “left behind” struggling to get fit/healthier.
 I just wanted to be honest that my lack of confidence and progress on the baby front is making me feel bleurgh about other people’s successes. So I suppose I just want someone to tell me that I’m not the worst person in the world and that this normal, because I certainly don’t feel that way :(","Mrs Fab! How insensitive is your pregnant friend, and how annoying is your instagram friend! 

CW: loss
After my loss, I thought ""alright Marbles, let's get fit and healthy and lose some kilo's and then get back in the game."" Well, here I am 4 months later. Still the same weight as the day after my loss. It's hard to get the energy and motivation when you're not where you want to be in life, and when you're seeing other people with the things that you want in life. So you're not on your own. Be kind to yourself.

Alsooooo, I know I've had a good bitch about my SIL on this sub, but she literally lies on instagram every single day. People eat it up and assume she is this ""natural"" mum who has her kids eating organic veggies and taking her kids on great adventures. Well, she actually feeds her kids sausages (and not many veggies) and sits on the lounge watching tv, not taking the kids on adventures. And I know so many people that do this. They want you to believe their life is amazing, even if it's not. SIL was also insensitive about her pregnancy with me, so now I barely speak to her. But I feel better in my day to day life.

Do whatever you want, if you want a break from these people then go nuts. Or maybe tell them what's going on so they can be more sensitive. If they are good friends then they should understand. And you're not the worst person in the world. I've seen your posts, you're a great person. Don't ever forget it.

Anyway she gave birth 4 months ago and has now become a wellness mum instagrammer and is giving out “inspiration tips” on how to be like her. 
I can’t explain why it rubbed me up the wrong way but it’s the realisation that people around me are having babies and looking/feeling great and I’m here still POAS, “left behind” struggling to get fit/healthier.
 I just wanted to be honest that my lack of confidence and progress on the baby front is making me feel bleurgh about other people’s successes. So I suppose I just want someone to tell me that I’m not the worst person in the world and that this normal, because I certainly don’t feel that way :(",2.577047109603882,2.5855185985565186,2.832455277442932,1.9697872400283811,2.96828830242157,2.126118779182434,2.0031238794326782,3.3905563354492188,2.344809055328369,2.617696046829224,3.1038451194763184,2.471956729888916,3.31740951538086,3.434631824493408,1.551061928272247,1.625970423221588,2.9266542196273804,3.153221368789673,3.644946813583374,3.526820659637451,1517,0,"Mrs Fab! How insensitive is your pregnant friend, and how annoying is your instagram friend! 

CW: loss
After my loss, I thought ""alright Marbles, let's get fit and healthy and lose some kilo's and then get back in the game."" Well, here I am 4 months later. Still the same weight as the day after my loss. It's hard to get the energy and motivation when you're not where you want to be in life, and when you're seeing other people with the things that you want in life. So you're not on your own. Be kind to yourself.

Alsooooo, I know I've had a good bitch about my SIL on this sub, but she literally lies on instagram every single day. People eat it up and assume she is this ""natural"" mum who has her kids eating organic veggies and taking her kids on great adventures. Well, she actually feeds her kids sausages (and not many veggies) and sits on the lounge watching tv, not taking the kids on adventures. And I know so many people that do this. They want you to believe their life is amazing, even if it's not. SIL was also insensitive about her pregnancy with me, so now I barely speak to her. But I feel better in my day to day life.

Do whatever you want, if you want a break from these people then go nuts. Or maybe tell them what's going on so they can be more sensitive. If they are good friends then they should understand. And you're not the worst person in the world. I've seen your posts, you're a great person. Don't ever forget it.

I have already wrote back and said no thank you. I just cant come to terms with being celebrated for my service. I did a lot of things i'm not proud of. I dont have enough digits on my body to count the times I wish I would've died over there. Not only have I really struggled with PTSD for years, but also survivors guilt. Why did I make it home, but my best friend didn't. My other best friend has lost both of his legs and one arm. Here I sit with just my mind being messed up. I cant imagine what it is he has had to deal with. 

I'm not saying this for some sympathy vote. I know there's some other service men on this reddit. I'm wondering if they feel the same way as I do. I know some guys are really proud of what they did. They wear their medals on the regular. Personally, mine is gathering dust in my closet and will probably never see the light of day again. 

So now I focus all my effort on bodybuilding. Its what keeps me alive. And i mean that. Without it, I would surely be dead. 

Any other service men out there wanting to chat, hit me up. Not sure why this simple email I received is messing me up, but I guess i'll just use it as fuel in my next workout. 

 

","Just think of it this way.

You shoulder the burden so others don't have to. You take the weight for others who couldn't bear it. You went and fought and saw things and did things that are inconceivable to the average person so that average person could sleep soundly. 

Literally, you gave up your safety and the peace of mind for the rest of your life (unless you come to terms with everything) so others wouldn't have to think about it at all. 

While you might not want to share your story with a crowd (and thus not go to the game and everything), hopefully you can see what it's like to those of us who understand how awful things can be in war but are lucky to have not been in those situations themselves.  

Life's a journey. Try to be thankful for everything you go through. When you suffer, when you cry, when you're happy, when you're angry, try to relish what you feel and what you experience. With the bad things, it's sort of like giving yourself Stockholm syndrome; if you can learn to love the worst experiences just for yourself being alive and present there, you'll certainly be able to appreciate your life as a whole. Side note: when I'm doing cardio (in particular, stairclimber) or slaving away at manual labor or anything else and the sweat and pain and everything are wearing me down, I remember that whole idea. I learned to fall in love with the feeling of ounces of sweat rolling off me and the overwhelming heat and the torn calluses from shovels and everything else. Feeling stuff is pretty incredible if you really try it. It took me years and years to figure that one out.

One day, on your deathbed, you'll look back and be thankful for every second you spent on this rock, even the ones that seemed awful at the time (or for years afterwards). If you can convince yourself now that every moment and every feeling are a miracle of chance, you won't have to search for a reason to go on; living will be the reason and you'll never regret it. Good luck.

##1) Find a small thing you can do better every day and can be proud about.   
It does not matter how little or large it is - it is for you. Whether it be brushing you teeth better or picking up a piece of rubbish on the road that someone else left there - find a thing you can do. 

##2) Become an expert at it.   
Make those Chompers pearly white. This takes time. It will take several weeks for any results but you will start to notice the difference and so will others. Change doesn't happen overnight and committing to change is what will bring about those thoughts of accomplishment.

##3) Tell someone.  
Or just fucking say it... In the mirror or at the park on a bench by yourself. Vocalise your achievements no matter how small or large they are. ""I brushed my teeth better today than yesterday, and I have been doing it for a month and now my teeth are very healthy"". Ask yourself what you achieved today, say out loud you achieved it, and move on to the next thing that you need to achieve.

##4) Rinse and repeat   
Ain't nothing like practice to make things perfect. Find little things you can do something about and get better at them. Tell yourself you succeeded when you do it. Literally fucking say it. You will find in time that the bigger things are more achievable either in one step or by breaking them up into smaller steps. 

Do it at your own pace.

Fuck stress.

Make those Chompers pearly white. This takes time. It will take several weeks for any results but you will start to notice the difference and so will others. Change doesn't happen overnight and committing to change is what will bring about those thoughts of accomplishment.

##3) Tell someone.  
Or just fucking say it... In the mirror or at the park on a bench by yourself. Vocalise your achievements no matter how small or large they are. ""I brushed my teeth better today than yesterday, and I have been doing it for a month and now my teeth are very healthy"". Ask yourself what you achieved today, say out loud you achieved it, and move on to the next thing that you need to achieve.

##4) Rinse and repeat   
Ain't nothing like practice to make things perfect. Find little things you can do something about and get better at them. Tell yourself you succeeded when you do it. Literally fucking say it. You will find in time that the bigger things are more achievable either in one step or by breaking them up into smaller steps. 

Do it at your own pace.  
Fuck guilt.  
Fuck stress.  
You are in control.",2.5530563592910767,1.6254894137382507,3.2392616271972656,2.5608614683151245,2.9810268878936768,1.9783517718315125,2.376504421234131,3.370978832244873,1.9926332831382751,2.403587937355041,2.96055805683136,1.9179174304008484,3.7089860439300537,3.0850486755371094,2.1089972257614136,1.2771811485290527,3.1177690029144287,3.470038414001465,3.68679404258728,3.0747411251068115,3.849109411239624,4.017109394073486

They have violated his privacy and gone against what his wishes would have been. He was distant and very private toward them and had a lot of boundaries in place with them. I feel like they took his death as an opportunity to try to see what was going on inside his mind, so they hacked everything they could. But this isn't what he would have wanted.

I feel like I can't keep going. I did contact a grief counseling agency and they told me I need to wait 3 months after he has passed because I'm in too much shock right now.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling in the sky the message He is Dead, Put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun. Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; For nothing now can ever come to any good.

W. Auden Funeral Blues

This is the poem that brought me comfort because it perfectly captured how I felt. I want you to realize that you gave him an incredible gift. No one should ever leave this life having never known love and hope, and because of **you**, he was able to know both in his final years. That is a gift that is beyond compare. You gave him real unconditional love, and hope that he was going to have a happy future. That is so important.

Also think about how he didn't want you to be hurting or suffering. He wanted you to be ok. And because of that, you will be. 

Loaing someone you love is the most intense pain there is. Right now you are being knocked down by these huge tsunami size waves of grief. As the days go on, those waves will get smaller and smaller. They will never go away. I won't lie to you. But they will be more tolerable. They will always be there, but in smaller and smaller ways until its more like standing at the edge of the beach and having waves up to your knees cascading past, instead of drowning you. One day you will come to embrace those waves because they bring with them all the good memories you shared him. So right now all you can do is keep treading water, keep yourself afloat until your feet can touch the ground again. Take it five minutes at a time. You've made it through the last five, you will make it through the next five.

His family is desperately trying to grasp for what little control they have left over him now. That is why the hacking and not considering what he would have wanted. They will remember him in their way, as messed up as it is, but you are here to remember and honor the *real him*. That is what you can do for him now. You can be the person who was most important to him, who knew him best, and who can honor him the way he would have wanted. Always remember that he finally got to experience love and hope because of you. That is, frankly, the best gift you could ever give to anyone. And you did that.",1.0,2.0,1528,1,"Thank you.

I just still don't know how he died. I wish I had the vet do the autopsy, but it was gonna be really expensive and I couldn't afford it back then. 


Archie was always a healthy bunny and there were no changes indicating that something was wrong. He was behaving completely normal the night before, eating and cuddling with me in the bed before I put him in his cage for the night. The cage was in the same room as my bed, but I heard nothing. When I woke up in the morning, I found him in his cage lying on the ground unable to move his head. It looked like he did something to his spine, because his head was twisted in a really weird position and he was not able to lift it up. He had no control of his head at all. I know about head tilt, but I've seen pictures of it and it looked a bit differently. Besides, it literally happened over night and progressed so quickly. 


To this day, I still think that he probably waited on me to get up, because he died in my arms 10 minutes after I found him and started frantically calling the vet :(  I also tried to feed him with no success. There was just no chance to save him anymore and I still kind of blame myself for what happened and if I could have somehow prevented it.

I remember being devastated over it for a long time and even now I still cry when I think about it. He was the best though and I try to remember only the happy stuff :)  Like that he loved to be petted, but as soon as you tried to go for his chin, he would turn into a devil, he hated it so much xD","Awww, please don’t blame yourself! It sounds like he just have done something and inadvertently hurt himself. I don’t know that there’s anything you could have done to prevent it. I often worry and check in on my own buns, and have to try to make peace with the fact that I’m really doing all I can to keep them safe and healthy.

789,789,1.5,"So I'm fucked off at my father still. I'm actually contemplating borderline disowning the cunt as this stage.

A few of you know a few years back I postponed my application for Pre-Medicine to head back across the country to my home town and put my palliative nursing skills to service in looking after my last remaining grandparent, my Nana because my dad was running himself into the ground trying to be full time carer for himself and my mother who lives with a disability. And his sisters (my cunt aunts and extended family did fuck all to help)

At the time my Nana's prognosis was something like 6 months and so I thought after it had all came to pass I could go back to Melbourne as re-accept my deferred application. This also stops Nana going into hospice which was something that she and everyone else didn't want at the time. Being in a small town the home nursing services are incredibly limited and not really of help.

So I move in, 4 months in, she gets a diagnosis of spontaneously remission in her secondary cancer, (she had metastatic skin cancer, and her chemo/radiation combo gave her secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma), so her prognosis for an extended life is longer in that regard other than the increasing debilitation of her skin cancer.

So the best part of 5 years drag on, my Pre-Med Acceptance is declined. I'm a 24/7 live in nurse across all aspects of care and house keep for Nana so she doesn't have to be in a home. Little time off othe than a couple of chances to get away. No energy or time for a job as well, other than reddit, there wasn't much else to keep me sane. 

One week after the funeral the cunt aunts and my dad ask me to leave the house or start paying rent (bearing in mind i was not paid other than a small government stipened for looking after Nana for ll this time, which in hospice fees alone would have been $130k a year at least).... So they can sell the place asap and get the money. I move into a friends house, buy a car and drive across the country to move here. The house sits empty for 18 months. I get no family member saying thank you for looking after her, but her friends in the community did.

Now, Nana was cremated after the funeral service and it was her wishes to be returned to her home of The Isle of Wight in the UK and be scattered there. Her ashes have been sitting at my aunts until someone goes back to the UK or they mailed her because that's what she wanted.

I get a SKYPE message at 1.50pm my time yesterday from my cunt father that reads in part ""we are going to scatter (most) of your Nan's ashes today at 2pm in the river (of my home town) so she'll be with your Grandad. A small parcel of her ashes is on it's way to the Isle of Wight""...

I get NO prior warning so that I can be there, I get nothing. I spent the better part of 5 years looking after Nana when no one else was willing to, and informing her of her rights across her medical care and ability to make informed decisions in regards to her care instead of just making her or guilting her to  do shit like her fucking kids did... and I don't even get invited to see her final farewell.

When I asked why I or my sister wasn't told sooner, I got told that I couldn't have afforded to go over there anyway... I'm thinking in my mind: You fucking CUNT you were given over $120k in inheritance, you could have flown my sister and i over and back if you wanted us there....

I'm beyond pissed and upset. I know that if the tables were turned it would have been the worlds biggest drama. 

FUCK my father and my family. Fucking histrionic narcissists.

Am I over reacting? Urgh.

Taking a break from the adderall at the moment.  Not doing this shit because of his death per-se, but it definitely sent me back into my suicidal depression state, which I kinda wanted to happen; my worst trait is self-sabotage.

I miss Mac a lot, but I really just don’t want to be alive anymore, I’d probably be in that mindset even if he was still alive.

Attempted suicide twice by low drop hanging and failed both times, burst all the capillaries around my eyes but that extinct to live pulled me out of it. Maybe I’ll have the balls one day to finally day. I turned 27 thirteen days ago, I don’t want to see the a single day of age 28.","I wish I could take your pain away. Makes me so sad to read this kind of thing, and you're still so young. If you want to talk you can message me. Personally I have found it very therapeutic to come to this sub and see people sharing their stories/pictures/videos/whatever of Mac. The idea of a bunch of people cutting their own little section of the internet out to share some positivity and support to each other all because we have this common interest, we all enjoyed this guy's music, is so beautiful.

Please don't hurt yourself or end your life. You can find people that want to help. I don't know the origin of this saying but I've seen it around Reddit, something like, ""suicide doesn't take away the pain, it passes it to someone else"". Below are some options to find some help. Stay safe.

Now I’m downing 1mg XR Xanax a few times a day, drinking bourbon and beer and taking my anti-psychotics scripts at night which lowers my blood pressure and heart rate. Taking a break from the adderall at the moment.  Not doing this shit because of his death per-se, but it definitely sent me back into my suicidal depression state, which I kinda wanted to happen; my worst trait is self-sabotage.

I’m a huge believer in if it’s meant to be, then it’ll happen. You never know, it could bring you two closer. But don’t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. No matter how much you love them! You don’t seem very happy with this arrangement. And believe me, it’ll only get worse if you’re not getting what you clearly know you need. You’ll set yourself up for a lifetime of sacrifice and disappointment. At least you know what you really want in a relationship!

My previous was a LDR and I was so set on never setting foot into another one so soon again. It was just a pity that he announced with no warning and very early into our relationship that he wanted a job across the country. The only reason I am doing this LDR is for him, clearly he is not doing it for me and I am not making myself happy doing it either. I really want it to work it out but it is eating me everyday and I do not know where to turn to",2.6533955335617065,1.982543408870697,3.283764362335205,2.296420693397522,2.9431369304656982,2.1309876441955566,2.587414503097534,3.2097575664520264,2.750703454017639,2.914956212043762,3.149970293045044,2.267821431159973,3.705193519592285,3.68703556060791,2.014206051826477,1.5711959600448608,3.212540864944458,3.5863094329833984,3.7632110118865967,3.452102899551392,1599,0,"Never,  ever do LDR for someone else unless you’re wanting to do it for yourself too.

My mom picked me up, but of course she had to drag along my transphobic dad and brother. Luckily she didn’t tell them anything. I can’t really feel anything rn which is better than feeling like killing my self I guess. I’m trying to get my mom to put a lock on my door so I can sleep without someone walking in my room at night to get something and seeing my binderless chest (my room used to be an office and still has the printer and file cabinets so people come in and out often). I’m switching from feeling nothing to feeling like I’m about to cry. Life is weird but if I didn’t do it today in a few weeks I’d tell myself “I should’ve done it then, it would be the perfect moment, by now everything would be sorted out” so Atleast I don’t need to be guilting myself.","I'm sorry to hear life is so rough right now.

I don't know how much comfort it offers, I know it didn't help me much when I was in similar situations, but time will pass and one day your family won't be the total authority and influencer on your worth.

It very much sounds like right now the rough waters you're in are spinning you through a shitton of emotions that are just hard to cope with. Nothing is wrong with you, you just have a lot on your plate right now. Definitely life is made from a series of experiences, and regardless of any ""what-ifs,"" you came out! That's always a hard thing to do and you can feel proud of yourself for getting yourself to this point. It's now a piece of your life story.

I highly recommend breathing and meditation type exercises. It doesn't have to be om-type stuff, just methods through which you can recenter yourself, take your mind out of any kind of hamster-wheel of thought it's on, and feel a little more stable again. It helps me a bit until nature can take its course and stuff relaxes again.",5.0,5.0,1600,1,"I’m sorry I was so overwhelmed when I posted this, I was litterally crying in a shower having a panic attack.
