I changed careers for her when our relationship was stagnant because I needed to finish college to move with her and I was willing to move to another country for her.

She went out of her way to say hurtful things to me and even went so far as to tell me that she was with me, because she didn't think she could do better.

Just block her everywhere and claim back your power. You were not born to be emotionally enslaved by somebody who doesn't give a s*** about you.
Block her everywhere, that's the first step.
After that, you have to give yourself closure and there are many techniques that can be used to do that.

14,1328,BreakUps,t3_o7zepj,o7zepj,"We broke up 2 months ago. And some mornings I wake up crying still. Our relationship lasted 7 years and I still can’t believe it’s over. It was a very clean and respectful breakup and we both know had reasons we broke up. It wasn’t because we didn’t love each other. It was because of external factors - and he got tired of dealing with it, I didn’t want to see him hurt. 

I am working to make those factors go away. But I dreamt of him last night, and in my dream he treated me like a total stranger. It scared me so much. I was NOT ready to see him, especially like that. And the dream felt so real… Why are dreams so cruel. 

Now I am so anxious for the day when this will actually happen. I want us to get back together but I need to fix things before doing so. I don’t want him to unlove me because I still love him so much. It hurts guys. We don’t talk but we do have mutual friends. How do I cope?",h31zru5,"I feel you. Your dream is about your fear and its not necessarily that is going to happen, but its all because you're scared and anxious about the idea of him stopping to love you . Don't forget that even if you had a respectful breakup you will be sad and heartbroken for a while and thats how you're coping. 7 years aren't easy, you had a life time with him but sometimes we don't get what we want and thats fine, life have so much possibilities and you can always find the light in every darkest moments. Everything you need is time, and to try to focus your brain on yourself, work on yourself, and not because for getting back together, if you wanna fix things do it for yourself, and whatever is yours will come to you. When i broke up with my ex it took me a lot of self-care, meditations, crying nights and daydreaming about us coming back together, until i reach to a point and it was : acceptance.

Please, mourn that relationship as much as you can, cry your eyes out, but don't be hard on yourself neither blame her. Relationships are lessons, and that pain will go away i promise.","target:

We broke up 2 months ago. And some mornings I wake up crying still. Our relationship lasted 7 years and I still can’t believe it’s over. It was a very clean and respectful breakup and we both know had reasons we broke up. It wasn’t because we didn’t love each other. It was because of external factors - and he got tired of dealing with it, I didn’t want to see him hurt. 

I am working to make those factors go away. But I dreamt of him last night, and in my dream he treated me like a total stranger. It scared me so much. I was NOT ready to see him, especially like that. And the dream felt so real… Why are dreams so cruel. 

Now I am so anxious for the day when this will actually happen. I want us to get back together but I need to fix things before doing so. I don’t want him to unlove me because I still love him so much. It hurts guys. We don’t talk but we do have mutual friends. How do I cope?

I feel you. Your dream is about your fear and its not necessarily that is going to happen, but its all because you're scared and anxious about the idea of him stopping to love you . Don't forget that even if you had a respectful breakup you will be sad and heartbroken for a while and thats how you're coping. 7 years aren't easy, you had a life time with him but sometimes we don't get what we want and thats fine, life have so much possibilities and you can always find the light in every darkest moments. Everything you need is time, and to try to focus your brain on yourself, work on yourself, and not because for getting back together, if you wanna fix things do it for yourself, and whatever is yours will come to you.

She did say anything back, she just kissed me. I thought it was a good sign but I was really wrong.

The strangest thing is that after telling me these things we walked a bit and then we kissed again, so I didn't really know what to think at that point... I thought maybe she was just having some soubts but I thought things would have worked out in the end. I was wrong again

I'm very shy and I find it difficult to express my feelings... so I took my time and at our 4th date I was finally able to tell her I liked her and I was interested in her, something that was more than obvious at that point. 

She did say anything back, she just kissed me. I thought it was a good sign but I was really wrong. For the next few days she was very and cute kind with me via text, sending kisses and stuff like that, something she never did before. This until the next weekend, we hanged out again and she told me she had to talk to me. She told me that I was a nice guy and that she really enjoyed hanging out with me but that her kiss changed nothing for her, that I was too much into her and she couldn't give me want I wanted, so it was better for me to stop seeing eachother and end things there. Obviously I was shocked, I couldn't imagine this complete overturn in just 5 days.

The strangest thing is that after telling me these things we walked a bit and then we kissed again, so I didn't really know what to think at that point... I thought maybe she was just having some soubts but I thought things would have worked out in the end. I was wrong again

The next day I texted her and she just became really cold, she was trying to avoid any kind of contact with me, she even found out excuses for a few times when I asked her to talk in person, till I finally was able to do so. She didn't change her mind, so things just ended. To be honest they never even started.

I'm so confused, where did I go wrong? If she didn't like me why didn't she just told me? Why after a month of dates she wasn't sure about anything and she had to kiss me to find out she didn't want anything from me? I'm really confused",3.726618528366089

",3.0069098472595215,51,0,"I've been having a rough couple of weeks. Work is stressful, most of my friends have either moved away or are starting their own families, and I'm fairly certain that the girl I've been spending time with is very toxic to my mental state. I'm having a hard time finding the point or joy in anything.

I'm constantly worrying where I stand with this girl, at times it feels like we're dating, but it also seems like she doesn't want a relationship. We kiss every time we're together, we've been very close to having sex, but I feel like every time we start getting very close she pulls away. This has been going on for about 5 months. I should probably let her know how I feel, if nothing else just so we're clear, but if she says that she isn't interested in dating then I have to walk away because I know it will wreak havoc on my mental health to be around her. And I don't want to because I really enjoy spending time with her. The part that is most upsetting is that we've been through this before, it was 8 years ago and it had the exact same outcome. I said how I felt (admittedly in a dumb/drunk way) and then she stopped spending time with me.

I'm going to talk to her about it this week after we go to a play together. But I'm honestly dreading it. I feel like I know the outcome and I'm going to fall harder into my depression because of it. I'm already waking up with massive anxiety every morning, so I guess it wont be too different then.

And I'm not going to be able to see my two best friends as much anymore after the next two weeks. One is moving to DC next week and the other is having his first child. I'm very, very happy for both of them, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that it really gets me down. Just feeling lonely as fuck.",3.0600743293762207

We had been together almost a year, and we hadn’t been fighting, were still seeing each other regularly, everything was going great. We were happy.

He immediately broke down in tears and started saying things like “I really don’t want to do this. I hate doing this” but proceeded to tell me he thought it was best if we ended things. He said he needed to figure himself out, that he hated who he had become. The whole time he was hugging me, kissing my forehead, and crying. He said he was so happy with me but needed to learn to rely on himself. When he left my house he said that he would miss me. 
Now just two days later, he is posting on social media pictures of his friends, about how work is going for him, and honestly seems to be happy. I posted a picture of my best friend and I, and he liked the post almost immediately. But we have yet to actually be in contact since the breakup. 
I know it’s silly to overthink small things like a social media like, but I am just overall confused with how he seems to be handling things. I really would like to get back together as I felt that our relationship could have continued to grow. I feel as though he really will come back to me. Am I just in denial?

There is a possibility that a relationship between the two of you could work in the future, but it won’t be the same relationship as it was — and that’s a good thing. That relationship didn’t work, and trying to make the same relationship work again will just end in more pain. As you both heal, you will become different, better people, and maybe those people will end up together.

I’ve thought a lot about the idea of holding on to “false hope” too, and my therapist told me something really helpful. She told me, “You don’t have to call it false hope, you can just call it hope.” She told me that a few weeks ago, and it has really stuck with me. It’s ok to have a little bit of hope. You shouldn’t cling on to the idea, and you shouldn’t direct your own growth based on the idea that it will happen, but it’s ok right now that part of you wants it and hopes for it.

Now just two days later, he is posting on social media pictures of his friends, about how work is going for him, and honestly seems to be happy. I posted a picture of my best friend and I, and he liked the post almost immediately. But we have yet to actually be in contact since the breakup.

40,320,death,t3_oamezb,oamezb,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this, but I needed somewhere to get this off my chest. My grandfather has cancer and is dying - he’s so weak now that he’s unable to use a spoon. I went to visit him just last week because my grandmother had to go to the grocery store and she doesn’t want to leave him by himself. I didn’t even know what to say to him - I tried talking about the weather and asking him what he’s been eating, but he has such difficulty speaking that you have to lean in close and ask him about four or five times before you understand. My mom said that he’s asked about me specifically but I know if I go to see him, I’ll just cry the whole time ( to make matters worse, I am currently on my period ), I’ll struggle to understand him, and I won’t know what to say back. 

I’m not good with death - when my great-grandmother passed a few years ago, I wouldn’t go look at her body and, instead of attending her funeral service, I spent the entire time in the basement reading Harry Potter and drinking coffee and trying to pretend I wasn’t in a funeral home.

I don’t know if this is the right place for this, but I needed somewhere to get this off my chest. My grandfather has cancer and is dying - he’s so weak now that he’s unable to use a spoon. I went to visit him just last week because my grandmother had to go to the grocery store and she doesn’t want to leave him by himself. I didn’t even know what to say to him - I tried talking about the weather and asking him what he’s been eating, but he has such difficulty speaking that you have to lean in close and ask him about four or five times before you understand. My mom said that he’s asked about me specifically but I know if I go to see him, I’ll just cry the whole time ( to make matters worse, I am currently on my period ), I’ll struggle to understand him, and I won’t know what to say back. 

I’m not good with death - when my great-grandmother passed a few years ago, I wouldn’t go look at her body and, instead of attending her funeral service, I spent the entire time in the basement reading Harry Potter and drinking coffee and trying to pretend I wasn’t in a funeral home.

What I learned from it is this.... take all the time and ways in which you express your grief you need. No two people will grieve in the same way. If any of the stages of grief come up, give them space, time and it's due attention for the moment. However, don't get stuck.

It's okay to NOT be okay. Perhaps your mom and brother would benefit from knowing that you too are struggling and that you are all feeling this together and are there for each other on the good days, the not so good days and all of them in between. Some days are rough grief stricken days, some days you can see a bit of the light shine through and other days are not quite as painful. I pray you find strength and hope for your journey.

Basically in these situations he pointed out how these events are tramatic and terrible. There is no good in that moment. We cannot change that.

But we are in a position where we can make the worst time in someone's life a little less difficult.

I would encourage you to consider attending the viewing/service/event (if this family has one) and watch for something: when the family very first arrives, they are going to be very apprehensive about the situation as their last memory of their loved one is in a very tramatic moment. Watch how they are heartbroken when they see their loved one in the casket. And watch how they are comforted (usually) by seeing their loved one was cared for and the moment was made so the family can have some peaceful moments with their loved one once again. 

Knowing that we are able give them a little extra time with their loved one can give you the strength to do the nitty gritty to ensure that can be done for them.

Those cases will still continue to suck, but having a grieving mother/spouse/sibling look at you, hold your hand and say ""thank you for helping me see my son/wife/loved one/etc. again"" is really powerful","target:

My husband is physically and emotionally abusive. He has given me 3 black eyes in the last 4 months. He used to be smarter than this and would only hurt me places where others wouldn’t be able to see. 

I used to work from home due to the pandemic (though the bruised eyes were visible on Zoom) and he didn’t need to be as careful then. 

I’m now back in the office and my coworker/friend pretty bluntly, but kindly asked me if I was OK, if he was hurting me and how she could help. I told her thank you, but I can handle it. I was mostly just shocked anybody had noticed/would approach me about it. She even looked like she was about to cry. 

Anyway, I’m sure many of you know how leaving can be more complicated than a lot of people make it seem. The best thing for me to do right now is stick it out and hide any signs of physical abuse from other people. It would be dangerous for anybody else to get involved.

I told her that no one is sympathizing with me as well and I don't want people to keep doing that. Her excuse for not sympathizing with me is that I have kids, parents, sisters to look forward to and she has lost her son. As if I didn't lose my husband , my life partner, my friend. At that moment I realized she is not in the correct mind and there is no point explaining it to her that she atleast has her husband alive, her other son alive, her grandkids.

I didn’t know the universe would give you so much love and happiness and rip it away from you in a moments time. I didn’t know I would ever be able to experience so much pain.

You are right, it feels like your heart is ripped out of your chest. The things you are feeling... let them come, it's a normal, natural part of the grieving process. Tears heal the soul and everyone grieves in their own timing, so take the time you need to feel like you've begun to put one foot in front of the other to make it through the day.

You will find a ""new normal"" which includes remembering him, taking a piece of him with you into each new day through memories of who he was to you and how much he meant to you. Breathe, cry, breathe, take a step, move forward... some days will feel like a crawl, some days will feel like you are heading backwards in a sea of grief, but it is all progress. 

I take comfort in knowing that God's word says, ""The last enemy to be defeated is death.""  I don't believe it was His original plan for us to experience grief, death, dying... but we do because He loves us so much that He gave us a free will to choose Him and we went astray choosing a sinful, selfish path instead. He also says that in heaven there will be no more pain, no more tears, no more sadness or pain. I look forward to the day when that will be a reality. I pray you find peace, comfort and strength to face each new day my friend. You will find your new normal soon, give it time. Blessings to you!!","target:

You deserve to be in a relationship with someone who treats you with respect and kindness, and who returns the feelings you have. 

I think it’s good to separate the two issues- the relationship you’re in from any other possibilities. Do you want to be in a long term romantic relationship with someone who, after almost a year, doesn’t love you? If you choose to end this relationship, you’re not throwing anything away. You’re recognizing that a relationship has run its course and you’re not prepared or willing to spend more time, energy, and effort in the situation. That’s not throwing things away. That’s being true to what you want and need in your life. 

So make a decision about the relationship you’re currently in based on its own merits.

There are so many people in the world. I won’t say there’s better. But I will say there’s different. There’s a lot of different out there. And the fact that you’re here right now- and neither option stands out? That sort of tells me that the relationship you’re in isn’t really doing what you need.","target:

You deserve to be in a relationship with someone who treats you with respect and kindness, and who returns the feelings you have. 

I think it’s good to separate the two issues- the relationship you’re in from any other possibilities. Do you want to be in a long term romantic relationship with someone who, after almost a year, doesn’t love you? If you choose to end this relationship, you’re not throwing anything away. You’re recognizing that a relationship has run its course and you’re not prepared or willing to spend more time, energy, and effort in the situation. That’s not throwing things away. That’s being true to what you want and need in your life. 

So make a decision about the relationship you’re currently in based on its own merits.

There are so many people in the world. I won’t say there’s better. But I will say there’s different. There’s a lot of different out there. And the fact that you’re here right now- and neither option stands out?

I’m here to read and to get to know how to deal with one of my closest friend. She has been depressed ever since she had her operation done with her thyroid. 
At times she’s okay but lately she’s been really really down and been really in a low spirit and low mood. 
Ever since this pandemic happened she became the bread winner of her family and she’s having also a hard time with work and also she’s been suffering with how the way she looks because before her operation she’s been skinny and after her operation she began to gain weight and this can’t be help because of her hormonal imbalance. 

I just don’t know what to say to her anymore. I feel like i’m not helping her because i’m just there to listen to her i don’t know what to say to help her fight it.",3.972991943359375
128,2667,CaregiverSupport,t3_o21sjm,o21sjm,"My mother, who is 76, had a massive heart attack and two mini strokes in March. Since then it has been back and forth to the hospital almost every week. She is not compliant with meds (she has gastritis and they hurt her stomach). So most of these hospital trips have resulted from her not taking her meds properly. 

She's a very emotional person with an anxiety disorder and cries most of the day when she isn't feeling well. This is very hard on me. I have Aspberger's and am not good at comforting people.

So yesterday she got up and fixed her breakfast then took her blood pressure and it was 180/90. She panicked and doubled up on her beta blocker. She had also been only taking half the prescribed dose of her blood thinner. This resulted in an episode of feeling light headed and her anxiety was out of control. We ended up calling 911 and she was brought to the hospital and released in a few hours. 

I know this is going to sound petty, but she ruined my day. She interrupted all three of my meals so I had to wolf them down. She called from the hospital and insisted that I come get her right away. I had a Fresh order coming and had just sat down to lunch. Then I had to do a bunch of things for her. I didn't rest all day. I had a long list of house chores and I did finish them around 8 p.m. and went to bed sore and exhausted. This was my one day off from work for the whole month. 

On top of struggling with anxiety myself, I am going through menopause, dealing with chronic pain, and have been battling a case of widespread hives for which I can't find a cause. Possibly stress. I barely slept all night because I itched all over.

She had doubts about me before. Never tried to resolve them with me. I had my issues, depression and anxiety got much worse over corona but I finally started fixing them again and was trying to put my life back on track. But she had already decided.

She came over today to pick up the rest of her stuff. We walked around each other like ghosts. It lasted 20 minutes. She left. No hug. Just a bye. I  looked out my window and saw her outside, sitting on the curb outside my apartment waiting for her taxi. Overwhelming sadness came over me.

**And what do I decide to do!?**

**I go downstairs? I thank her for all the good things we had together? I telll her that I’m happy she has always been there for me and that I’m sad that that’s no longer the case? I tell her that the end of the relationship was good for me too because I can finally work on myself and that I felt stuck? I tell her we can’t be friends and she just nodded and smiled, she felt the same. And worst of all i fucking tell her that I will be hoping that she changes her mind for a bit and then I will be able to move on? And she gave goodbye hug, said she’s sorry and left. It’s so obvious she’s happier now.**

Man, I should have left it at the shut door, should have left her waiting. No goodbye hug. It made it ten times worse. I feel like on day 1. Why the fuck did i do this, why am i so weak. In my mind it was gonna be a nice closure but it’s not. I feel like I fucked up even the smallest chance of her coming back even though i told myself before that i know there is no way shes coming back.

hello all, this is my first post on here. so sorry for any grammar or formatting issues. 

so basically, last month, my brother (15m) killed himself. he showed no warning signs, gave no indications, nothing at all. he had no prior history of any mental health issues, no behavioral issues, nothing at all. no one understands it. we also don’t know why, as he didn’t leave a note and there’s no information at all on his phone. it’s been crazy hectic for me and my family, and every day has been a struggle. he’s the first one to pass in my family since my great grandfather in 2001, so it’s taking a massive toll on me and my family. i just don’t know what to do with myself, and i don’t know how to move on, or carry on with “life as usual”. i miss him so much, it hurts sometimes. any advice with how to cope at all would be good. thank you all",h2isdio,"I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. 

Grief sucks. It’s like something you couldn’t imagine until you’ve lived with it. You don’t need to return to normal life right now.

I'm having a really hard time today and I recognize some of it could be me being hormonal thanks to the progesterone I'm on. I've been crying off and on for two days. This progesterone is making me feel like I'm pregnant but I'm getting nothing but BFNs so I'm pretty sure I'm not since my period is almost due. It's making me feel like I did when I was pregnant and reminding me that I lost it and that I would be almost 4 months pregnant right now if I hadn't. I just want to curl up in a ball and give up. I'm so tired. I haven't slept well in a couple of days and I've been spending time with my brother and his family (including my 3 year old nephew). Every time I go home from visiting with them I cry because I'm afraid I'll never have that. I'll never have the fun bath times and the reading a book to my baby before bed. I'm afraid I'll never get to watch my own child grow up.

I don't want to stop visiting with them because they don't live locally and I don't know when I'll see them again.

I don’t necessarily hate life, so it’s not that. Every morning when I wake up I hate the fact that I’m alive so much I cannot control myself. 

I don’t know, maybe I just feel broken. My loved ones don’t really understand and I’ve never heard of anything like this. It’s just getting to be so much sometimes. I do everything I can, I’ve been in therapy five years, I take all the medicine in the world (it feels like) and I try so hard to work on getting better. I’m just getting so overwhelmed by my depression every morning and it’s starting to weigh on me.

she thought she was a burden on us all and my excuses to not have to travel to see her regularly just confirmed in her head, that she was a burden, that i didn't care enough about her. my mother spent years years telling me that this time might be the last and basically making me feel like the shittiest granddaughter ever and that's something that will haunt me for the rest of my life. i missed so much time with her that i could have taken and cherished but i didn't and she must have been so lonely. 

I won't go into too many details but so many things went wrong and it was very sudden and i didn't go see her the night she took a turn for the worst because my mother told me to visit tomorrow instead but by the time I found out the next day it was too late. i never got to give her a cuddle and say goodbye while she was awake. and she didn't look comfortable at all. barely covered up a stupid backless hospital gown when all she would have wanted was to die in her soft, comfy PJs.

But listen. The ones around you who care about you are okay listening. Just be mindful of what’s on THEIR mind. You and your emotions are not always top priority. Use this to think of how to make them felt heard, because they probably need your reciprocation if you’ve been spending a lot of time voicing your grief.

Moments like this are also really important to evaluate who sees you as important, too. You should only consider having friends whom you feel can handle your emotions because life is only going to hit you harder as you get older. You WILL lose more people close to you. To time, careers, death, and unmutual separation.

As for me, I can get through a day without talking about her. But I can’t go a day without *thinking* about her. I can take a nap and have a lucid dream that we are laying in bed, and she looks at me and says “everything is fine”. But I wake up and remember her texting me that she’s “at peace with everything”.

Sorry. It sucks. Maybe at some point things will turn around and you can try again. But, as I’ve been doing, allow other people to give you the sex, validity, and care that you *need*. Because obviously the person you love wasn’t.","target:

I feel so guilty. 
Less than 2 weeks ago, my precious grandmother was murdered. She was shot and killed by a stranger. She was perfectly healthy. 

Rewind to the day before her death, I was discussing with a coworker grief and feelings of loss. I explained to her how I had lost a grandparent before (my grandpa on dads side) but it didn’t really effect me. I wasn’t close with him.  I said it was sad, but I had never truly experienced loss of grief of missing a loved one. 
I explained to her that when my grandmother died, it would be my first time to truly experience loss. And that it would devastate me. 

The next day, less than 24 hours later, my grandmother was shot and killed. 

To say I’m devastated is an understatement. She was a huge part of my life. She was very special in my heart. 

And I feel like her death was a jinx on my part. I feel like I jinxed myself having that conversation with my co worker the day prior. 
I feel like God was trying to humble me…saying “well now you have some grief to experience…”

And now I just feel terrible. I wish I never had that conversation. If I hadn’t, would she still be here?
I can’t help but wonder. 😔

Vlad has had some health issues the last couple of months and never really went back to himself. That being said we were never told a time or that it could happen so soon. We managed his symptoms one day he could just pass peacefully in his sleep.
He was at my mother's house. I got him when I was 14 so she enjoys her weekends with him and that's really his home, but he lived with me.
I got a panicked phone call asking if he ever had seizures before and he never had. I drove in as fast as I could and got him to the hospital. The vet said she could try a large dose of medicine all night but as he had been seizing for 1 hour and continued to combied with his past health she said the outcome is not a good one.
We choose to have him pass because his little cries tore my heart out

I am filled with guilt for leaving him, and for my mom who blames herself. My whole house is filled with his presence. I dont know how to stop the pain I'm feeling. I can't move his stuff from his places but I cry every time I think he will never be here.",3.7073326110839844

I found out a few weeks ago that he's got this lump on his neck that's been there for around 18 months and he's done NOTHING about it. Part of me is really angry/disappointed - especially given my Mum knew and didn't make him go to the doctor. I wish she'd told me and I would have got him to go... 18 f\*\*\*\*\*\* months. 

The lump on his neck is apparently a lymph node - 5cm by 5cm so, it's now quite visible. He's been to an ENT and they found nothing of interest. He has NO symptoms, no weight loss, no night sweats - nothing except for the lump on his neck.  


They did the biopsy on his neck and apparently it's cancer but they don't know where it is or what kind.

The CT and MRI have also shown nothing. There's a small lump on one of the adrenal glands, but they're not really sure if that's it as as above... no symptoms whatsoever.

He had some prostate issues a few years ago but his levels are all fine so I have no idea what to think.  


The doctor yesterday apparently seemed surprised by all of the above.

Has anyone else just had a lump but no symptoms? Is this a good sign or...

I've lost more people than I can count in my life. Suicides, illnesses, accidents, you name it.. But homicide? This is a first for me.    
It happened so suddenly. I just don't know how I'll ever move past this. We were on the phone, someone else called him so he said he'll call me back later. We texted a bit afterwards. I take a nap, I go to work, I come back, and he's gone. It literally feels like he literally said BRB and I'm still just waiting. I don't know how to stop waiting, even though I know....   


I've never felt such despair before. Our unconditional love, our growth, our future... It just got violently halted and I'm so angry. I'm SO ANGRY, but I can't hold that much hate in my heart, so it comes in waves. It honestly feels like I'm processing all 5 stages of grief at the same time. And believe me, I don't understand how I can be in so much denial while simultaneously knowing what is real. On top of already having depression, I feel like I'm falling apart. My heart physically hurts. Who knew that heartbreak was a real physical thing? T.T

They accepted my offer.  
  
A couple days later and i had some issues with one of their door locks. I put key in but it was really hard to turn. I messed w it for a bit and the center cylinder part of the lock completely turned and came out of the lock!  
  
I didnt know what to do. I tried another door and luckily the key worked, however, it set off their house alarm! The alarm company called the house owners so they are aware i had an issue. Did not tell them the lock completely stopped working.

I took care of my dad for about 8 months. He's bedbound with severe dementia and requires complete around-the-clock care. I had no help during this time, despite begging my mom multiple times to put him in a nursing home. Caregiving destroyed my mental health and caused me to have a mental breakdown. I ended up finally standing up for myself and setting a boundary with my mother: that I was done being a caregiver. After this, my mom stepped back in to take care of him.

It's been a few months and repairing my mental health is still a daily struggle. I was able to get him set up with hospice, so now Mom has a bit of help. However, she still refuses to put him in a nursing home.

Today I was asked to watch my dad for a few days, because my sister is driving up North for a funeral and needs someone to watch her 6 kids (my mom). My mom guilted me into caring for my dad again during this time because ""family just does that for each other"" (even though my sister literally never goes out of her way to help family, but that's another story). The other option I was given is to let my mom continue caring for Dad while *I* go stay at my sister's house for a few days to watch her kids (without any compensation, of course), which also sounds miserable. 

I feel like being a caregiver was actually traumatic for me, because the thought of having to do it again for just a few days has been giving me panic attacks.

I see people with real problems, look at how they are pushing through and here I am without any grave issues for now (I did lose my mom last year but I have been feeling like this from before) but still slugging. I feel ashamed for wasting away my life like this ! Departing from this world seems the only way to avoid all the miseries but I can't rn I am trying to hang around for a few years for my family.

Sometimes a person feels like they have to break up because they realize that you are incompatible, that they need to work on themselves or that you have simply grown apart. 

This kind of behaviour is more common in women. Women are much more controlled by their emotions which goes up and down continuesly. Man I am glad I am a male. 

She most probably loves you in many ways. But she has decided that she need to break up with you, reasons stated above. But this does not make it any easier for her. 

There is no way you will ever know exactly why she behaves like this but I recommend you to give her space.

Ex breaks up but:
- on the day after break up, comes home and stays minutes looking at me as if everything was alright, almost smiling
- after having entered no contact and on the day we parted ways, hugged me crying
- when I sent a text to ask when she’ll be home (only to know because she was supposed to get clothes), ghosted me for 10 days
- after 3 weeks, came by getting clothes but says she kept crying during 3 weeks
- said to me I am here if you want to talk
- but when I said to her “same for you, especially for you” since she was the one to break up, does not answer anything and does not try to communicate for one month
- told me: we are going to see each other again, right?

observer:

No side of a break up is easy. She is also going through a grief period, even if she was the one to break up. 

Sometimes a person feels like they have to break up because they realize that you are incompatible, that they need to work on themselves or that you have simply grown apart. 

This kind of behaviour is more common in women. Women are much more controlled by their emotions which goes up and down continuesly. Man I am glad I am a male. 

She most probably loves you in many ways. But she has decided that she need to break up with you, reasons stated above. But this does not make it any easier for her. 

There is no way you will ever know exactly why she behaves like this but I recommend you to give her space.

I am currently heartbroken. Someone that I thought I was going to marry and wanted to start a family with, suddenly and without warning stopped talking to me. I feel betrayed and extremely sad. I thought I had it figured out. She was stunning and wonderful but then all of the sudden, nothing. Am I being too sensitive? I am confused, sad, and hurt. I'm not eating and I have trouble sleeping. I wish you were here to help. I don't really know what to do.  I feel alone and sad. 

I miss you, 

Ben",h2wxfvl,"I am so sorry Ben. It is incredibly hurtful when people cut contact suddenly, especially with no reason offered and seemingly out of the blue. It's not what you expect from someone you love and it can feel like the legs have been cut out from under you. It's enough to make anyone feel emotionally desperate and is very hard to deal with.

What I want you to do is find yourself something you want to eat. A pie or a pizza, a cake, ice cream- anything at all you think you can stomach. You don't want to get out of the habit of eating and I want you to make sure you take care of your body, even though you're struggling mentally right now (totally understandable given the circumstances). Then, I want you to take the pressure off yourself. Feel your feelings, they are real and they are yours- give yourself time. It's OK to cry. But know that you will move past this.

You've are a strong person who has overcome challenges and sadness before. Your life is not going to take the path you thought it would, and it's OK to feel sad about that. It's hard. But believe me when I say that one day you will be able to look back on this as a dark time that you found your way through, that was necessary to get to where you needed to be- a path that needed to be walked. Life is about the journey rather than the destination and you have the tools you need to make it very worthwhile. 

Good luck to you. I know your mother would be proud.","target:

Since then her thyroid tumor masses have gotten so big that they have started compressing her throat and now she can’t eat. She wants to eat, she tries. But she can’t. And it’s the most heartbreaking thing. 

She is scheduled for in home euthanasia this Monday. I am worried I am torturing her by waiting until then to avoid her dying at the vet (she doesn’t like the vet). She has barely eaten in the last five days. Stopped eating pretty much in the last two. 

She is on pain meds and that seems to help a bit but I just feel so heart broken and in pain. I want to be good to her and do what’s best for her. I have never lost anyone close to me before not even a pet. That’s why I am writing this post. I just feel so lost. My heart is heavy. She is my best friend.

A month ago, tomorrow, will be 1 month since he hung himself in our attic. I dont know if I'm processing what happened...doesnt feel real. It's like I know this awful thing happened but I have stopped connecting it to my emotions...until something really triggers me. But now my whole life feels overwhelming (started my career 6 months ago and moved to a new city away from what I new. Moved in with my boyfriend.  and was already feeling overwhelmed. Went through the pain of a breakup. Then his suicide. Then had to move out of that house asap..found a new place and moved to a new town 20 min away. His brother doesnt want to talk to me. And there have been major changes at work..got a new supervisor and we changed our work medical record system). I completely relate the the ""door is open"" I struggle with severe OCD (purely thoughts), adhd, and a mood disorder.  Life right now feels SOOO much. Yesterday I had a panic attack at 9am in my car before going in to see a client (speech therapy). 
I feel like I cant just ""not"" work because I don't want people to think I'm being ""weak"" and I don't want to lose my job. Also..I'm so.broke from the move I'm barely living.
Good news tho...this made me make my mental health a priority and have counseling and dr appointments scheduled.
But the road to feeling better is long.
Suicide opens sooooo many doors. And I never thought it would happen to ""me""
I dont know why I cant connect emotionally anymore. Maybe it's because i have immense guilt about the situation. 
Hang in there.
We got this.",3.8523921966552734

Yesterday June 17th I found out I miscarried my baby. I went in for a second ultrasound at 9 weeks (first u /s was 7 weeks 1 day, with visible heartbeat) and there was no heartbeat this time. I knew it too, because I know what that flicker looks like and I know how it looks when there is no flickering heart on the ultrasound screen. She didn't tell me the BPM, had me stay changed, and came back with the doctor a few minutes later to have him watch too, to really make sure it wasn't there. Obviously it was not.

I had tried so hard to get that ultrasound for any day other than yesterday, any day other than June 17th. Because yesterday was the 12th birthday of my full term stillborn son (with ex husband). I tried to convince myself it was a good sign to have my follow up ultrasound on his birthday, praying there was no way I could lose two babies on the same day. Obviously it did not work out that way.

Now I am double heartbroken and I seem to be collecting angels.

But I don't want angels, I want a baby.

I am so sad. So so so sad.

I had been on the fence for years with my husband about wanting a baby (he has always wanted another -- has a 17 year old son from his first marriage). It took getting the positive pregnancy test to make me realize how badly I want a baby. How badly I want to start a family of our own with my husband.

I find I have some okay days but I struggle most days, and even some of the okay days can turn into a struggle. I’ve been trying to hang out with friends, and one of my friend’s wanted to go out. I felt okay, so I thought it could maybe be fun. We went out to eat and then went out to a bar. I was doing okay initially, I worried that maybe it was too soon to be going out with how much I’ve been struggling. But I initially felt okay. I know when I would go out with my fiancé I would have fun, and feel good and happy and I would feel confident in talking to people. Last night I felt okay talking to people initially, but then I started to feel like people didn’t want to talk to me and didn’t like me and only wanted to talk to my friend. I feel like ever since my fiancé has passed away, I don’t know who I am without him and I just always wish he was here. I feel like people don’t like me and I don’t even know why I find that so important. I just feel so much pain and I can’t imagine years without him here. I feel like sometimes I’m okay, but sometimes this feels so impossible. My friend was talking to some people in the bar and I just had to walk away because I started crying. She came and found me and I told her I just wanted to die. I said I hate being here without him. I said I feel like no one likes me and I don’t even know why I care because I don’t even want to be alive. I had been drinking a lot, but there was some truth to what I said. Some days I really don’t want to be here and just want to be with him again. I wouldn’t act on it because I know how devastating it is, but I do really feel that way. I feel so bad that I said all of that to my friend. She was really worried, and was so supportive. I just worry that I might push away my friends if I keep saying stuff like that.

My fiancé took his life nearly three months ago. I find I have some okay days but I struggle most days, and even some of the okay days can turn into a struggle. I’ve been trying to hang out with friends, and one of my friend’s wanted to go out. I felt okay, so I thought it could maybe be fun. We went out to eat and then went out to a bar. I was doing okay initially, I worried that maybe it was too soon to be going out with how much I’ve been struggling. But I initially felt okay. I know when I would go out with my fiancé I would have fun, and feel good and happy and I would feel confident in talking to people. Last night I felt okay talking to people initially, but then I started to feel like people didn’t want to talk to me and didn’t like me and only wanted to talk to my friend. I feel like ever since my fiancé has passed away, I don’t know who I am without him and I just always wish he was here. I feel like people don’t like me and I don’t even know why I find that so important. I just feel so much pain and I can’t imagine years without him here. I feel like sometimes I’m okay, but sometimes this feels so impossible. My friend was talking to some people in the bar and I just had to walk away because I started crying. She came and found me and I told her I just wanted to die. I said I hate being here without him. I said I feel like no one likes me and I don’t even know why I care because I don’t even want to be alive. I had been drinking a lot, but there was some truth to what I said. Some days I really don’t want to be here and just want to be with him again. I wouldn’t act on it because I know how devastating it is, but I do really feel that way. I feel so bad that I said all of that to my friend. She was really worried, and was so supportive. I just worry that I might push away my friends if I keep saying stuff like that. I have a therapist to talk to, and she’s wonderful. I just feel like I’m a mess, and my feelings are all over the place.

Today I was momentarily distracted and she climbed my neighbour's  fence. One of their dogs lunged at her, she was startled and fell. She's never been a great climber and couldn't make it back across. The four dogs mauled her before I could reach her. The neighbours struggled to get the dogs away and although she was still breathing when we reached her, she'd gone into shock, her face frozen with this otherworldly fear. When we reached the vet she was gone. I'm so so full of guilt for both my lack of attention and for stupidly letting her outside in the first place. It doesn't feel real and I still have this compulsion to go to the door to let her back inside.

I am so sorry for your loss, your girl was so lucky to have you. Also, please try not to place all the blame on yourself.

You loved her and wanted her to be as happy as possible, and I'm sure they loved your yard. In it's last moments it did have fear, but you were there by her side immediately comforting her pain.

But I opened the garage door too early, and tried to close it but it was too late. Our cat, one of two inseparable brothers was out and was killed by coyote. I wouldn’t have believed it had our neighbor not seen the animal running away. It’s not a common thing here, or we’ve just not seen it. 

I’m not looking for solace, it’s not deserved.  They trusted me, they loved me, and I let them down and I just don’t know how I’m going to live with this guilt and anger at myself.  Our other cat, his brother, is grieving with me, and doing my best to console him.  I posted here, as to not forget how incredibly stupid and how much that careless act has cost my family.

They both had poor health (dad had cancer and mum had mobility issues and struggled with alcohol) so sometimes even simple things seemed like a struggle.

They always strived to be good people and I felt like they got dealt a shitty hand. I did my best to make things easier but I just despair at the fact that things were so hard for them, even in the end. 

It all feels so overwhelming. I'm extremely lucky as I have a wonderful support system but it all feels so daunting. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the day to day in the beginning? Everything feels like such a fog right now

I know he would want me to move on. I’ve been thinking about dating again but I feel so guilty. And now that I’m back home I feel so alone. All of my friends are far away in college. No one around me has had a significant loss and I feel alienated. I just act like I’m okay so they don’t try to relate their breakups to his death. I just don’t know what to do. I just wake up and wait until it’s tomorrow. I’m relentlessly bored and I can’t move until my court case is settled. I genuinely promise I’m not going to kill myself but this is so hard. I don’t know what to do,3.971771001815796

Parkinsons caused him to develop early onset alzheimers. He called the police and attacked me because I was a stranger sleeping in his house. 
I moved ten minutes away from him although still very much involved in his daily routine. 

His family made a great deal about how they were going to help. Six months later my husband had neurostim surgery that his neurologist explained would have negative impact on his health. 
Three months later and not fully healed from the surgery his meal delivery driver found him dead. 
I visited the day before. Brought his favorite sandwich, had dinner with him, watched another few minutes of Band of Brothers and made sure he was comfortable before I went home. There was nothing out of the ordinary  even when I hugged him goodnight. 

Today is the anniversary of his death it's been three years and I am sobbing like a child. Beating myself up for not doing more for him.
Crying myself to sleep over situations I had absolutely no control over. The grief, guilt, sadness mix is overwhelming and it hurts so much.

Try not to be too hard on yourself for having emotions because it's normal.

You're doing everything right, but you could add blocking them and seeing a counselor or therapist to help with the emotional processing.  also you can tell a bunch of supportive and important people in your life like friends or family, which will get you more support, and also make it a lot harder for you to reverse your decision and go back into the abusive relationship.

Blocking them is a good step too because it helps end the cycle... Abusers tend to be really manipulative, and they also tend to know you pretty well, so blocking them is a good way to cut all of that off right away.

When I could sleep, I’d wake up in a cold sweat an hour or so later. I took a week off work because I couldn’t function; I was an absolute mess! I cried at some point every day for at least two months, but the pain became less and less unbearable with time. I started noticing tangible progress. My ex wasn’t the first thing I thought of when I woke up. They were maybe the second or third thought, but it was something. I’d go entire days without crying. I wanted some sort of quick fix but time is what helped. Try to get up and do things you enjoy, even if you don’t feel like it. Go for a walk, throw yourself into a hobby, get a new hobby, surround yourself with positive people, anything. I also found journaling to be incredibly therapeutic. Early on, I made a list of things that just weren’t working in the relationship and when I felt overwhelmed with sadness or anger, I’d pull it out and read it. Keeping busy is great for distraction, but also allow yourself time to just feel and process things. You will get through this, I promise.",4.191416263580322,671,0,"I’m so broken. It’s just been 24 hours since I’ve been dumped. I can’t stop crying. I can’t leave bed. I can’t move.

Please, somebody say it gets easier. I don’t know what to do. But sit here. And cry. And cry. And wallow.

I feel so much pain inside of me.",3.1982431411743164

She needs support and a good therapist to understand it, in fact, was a choice, both to do it and to lie to you about it.

But now I lost my beloved cat, she was 16 years old, I'm 29, half of my life, she was with me, she was my ultimate companion and confident, she was full of energy even if she was 15-16 years old, nothing on her showed me that she was about to pass, a month ago it got hard for her to eat, I tried many things, it got harder and harder, she was still fine though, and her litter box showed me she was eating, but she got really skinny, real fast.

I bought her an emergency cat food, for cats that don't eat at all, but it was too late, the day I came with that food was the same day she stopped eating 100%. on the next day, the vet told me she had kidney problems, that no matter what I do, she was about to die. She was so weak, so fast, in a matter of 2 days.

The next day I wanted to go to another vet and see a second option, but she was like, not here. She didn't react to food, smells, touch, catnip, her eyes were open, but she was just not there.

I decided to just let her go. Went to the vet and the euthanasia was done. My beloved cat is gone, I can't believe it, I can't understand a world without her, it's been 2 days and I miss her so damn much ...

I loved him more than anything, but my fear of how he's coping is probably why it was best I ended the relationship. I wanted to grow, he doesn't want to. I can't force that.

I know I have to accept that my brain is just wired at the moment to want to care for him, run back to him, call him, so I just have to let those feelings pass as they come.

I'm scared because he's the kind of person that buries his feelings, he's not going to get over it (maybe even choosing not to get over it) and it's going to effect his future relationships. I'm scared that his conclusion from this is that he's not good enough. I know I can't control all this, but it's hard.

I loved him more than anything, but my fear of how he's coping is probably why it was best I ended the relationship. I wanted to grow, he doesn't want to. I can't force that.

I know I have to accept that my brain is just wired at the moment to want to care for him, run back to him, call him, so I just have to let those feelings pass as they come. It feels like every day I have to let go over and over and over. This sucks man. I did what was right though, and the best outcome of this is that he learns and matures.

I’m 33 and I experienced my first (and hopefully only) miscarriage of my first pregnancy in April. I was devastated and so lost. It was so crazy to have gone through such a high and then such a low in so little time. I was about 8-10wks along. 

When I was pregnant my doctor found a kind of big ovarian cyst. It hasn’t been getting bigger, but hasn’t reduced in size either. And it sounds like the best, and most sensible, thing for me to do is schedule a surgery to get it taken care of so I can experience my next pregnancy with fewer concerns. 

The problem that I’m experiencing is 1) the frustration in scheduling with doctors…I feel like it’s taking forever for me to get appointments to even schedule a surgery. I hate how small and insignificant the healthcare system makes me feel. 

And 2) I am so frustrated with the wait to try getting pregnant again. I know, I could probably still ttc with the cyst, but I also just want to take care of my own health first. 

Adding to this frustration is that it seems like everyone is pregnant. Worse yet, a family member recently announced their pregnancy even after years of saying they were disinterested in having kids.

I’m just sharing this little frustration. I know that there are so many people out there experiencing much worse, and I should feel thankful for so many things, but I just can’t shake my grief and impatience.",h2ikk86,"I am so sorry for your loss .
Your feelings are very valid and completely understandable .

It sounds like you are definitely doing the right thing looking after your own health before you ttc again, but I completely understand what you are feeling with the waiting . And feeling like you’re just another number in the medical world. Waiting for appointments, waiting for surgery then waiting for a new cycle etc etc… the waiting is so hard. After all of my miscarriages the desperate, burning, all consuming need to try again straight away is something I can’t even explain or put into words. I was so anxious to be pregnant again that it feels like a physical pain , but I know it’s a feeling that many people here will know too well.

363,2620,widowers,t3_o2rwz7,o2rwz7,"I honestly don’t even know why I’m posting this. I just don’t know how to deal with any of it..
My husband died 3 weeks ago from brain cancer. He was 31, and we’ve been together for 6 years, married for one. 
I was the one taking care of him full-time for the past year and a half since he got sick, and the last 3 months were just terrible. His family was of no help and are actually making my life even harder now. I feel like I’m not even able to grieve him.
When I thought things couldn’t possibly get any worse, I found out that he cheated on me on at least one occasion a couple of months before he got sick, with a fully elaborate plan where he rented out a place for the night when I was visiting my siblings. He slept with an older woman (40-45), i have no idea who she is. 
I loved him so much, I gave him my life, I stopped studying and working to care for him when his family wouldn’t even visit him, it was a 24/7 job, I’m exhausted. And now I’m just angry and sad and confused. He’s not even here for me to yell at him! How could he do that to me! I feel like my life with him was a lie, that he only stayed with me because he needed me to take care of him. He had a lot of time to come clean or clear his conscience but never did! 
How do I move on from this? I feel like I never even knew him.. I thought he was the best thing that ever happened to me but now I think maybe he was the worst thing to happen and I wish I never loved him. The worst part is that I probably would have forgiven him if he told me..

EDIT: Thank you everyone for putting in the time to tell me your story and to give me much needed advice.
I decided to tell my therapist (I was too embarrassed to tell him or anyone else) and I hope I can start working on myself and on forgiving him.. for now I feel like my memories of our life together are tarnished, but I hope I can get them back at some point. It’ll eat me up inside if I lose them 
What a weird life..",h28g1d4,"I think if you would have forgiven him when he was alive, then it's probably the right choice to forgive him now. I don't think it would have been right for him to tell you while he was sick and you were caring for him, and he probably knew he had made a mistake and hoped to spare you the hurt you are now feeling.

I found out things about my husband after he died that have been very hard to accept, but I don't have a choice--they are facts, and I have to just adjust my perspective of him. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. As others have said, you'll have a broad range of feelings, and they're all valid.

People are complex, and we make bad choices sometimes. I hope when I die that anything anyone who loves me finds out about me doesn't make them love me less, or believe that I loved them less. I'm not perfect, and my husband wasn't perfect, and that is how I am coping with it. Wishing you peace as you navigate your labyrinth.","target:

I loved him so much, I gave him my life, I stopped studying and working to care for him when his family wouldn’t even visit him, it was a 24/7 job, I’m exhausted. And now I’m just angry and sad and confused. He’s not even here for me to yell at him! How could he do that to me! I feel like my life with him was a lie, that he only stayed with me because he needed me to take care of him. He had a lot of time to come clean or clear his conscience but never did! 
How do I move on from this? I feel like I never even knew him.. I thought he was the best thing that ever happened to me but now I think maybe he was the worst thing to happen and I wish I never loved him. The worst part is that I probably would have forgiven him if he told me..

EDIT: Thank you everyone for putting in the time to tell me your story and to give me much needed advice.
I decided to tell my therapist (I was too embarrassed to tell him or anyone else) and I hope I can start working on myself and on forgiving him.. for now I feel like my memories of our life together are tarnished, but I hope I can get them back at some point. It’ll eat me up inside if I lose them 
What a weird life..

observer:

I think if you would have forgiven him when he was alive, then it's probably the right choice to forgive him now. I don't think it would have been right for him to tell you while he was sick and you were caring for him, and he probably knew he had made a mistake and hoped to spare you the hurt you are now feeling.

I found out things about my husband after he died that have been very hard to accept, but I don't have a choice--they are facts, and I have to just adjust my perspective of him. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. As others have said, you'll have a broad range of feelings, and they're all valid.

People are complex, and we make bad choices sometimes. I hope when I die that anything anyone who loves me finds out about me doesn't make them love me less, or believe that I loved them less. I'm not perfect, and my husband wasn't perfect, and that is how I am coping with it.

I have no words for her, I harbor nothing but resentment for her. The fact that she did that, multiple fucking times, shows me and anyone else that she is weak. Weak minded and weak willed. She is probably justifying it as she did with me, but that just shows ignorance and emotional immaturity.

This is a chronic issue of hers, and I see it now. She broke up with her ex and got with me the next day, broke up with me and got with him 2-3 weeks later as far as I’m concerned. 

I have no words for her, I harbor nothing but resentment for her. The fact that she did that, multiple fucking times, shows me and anyone else that she is weak. Weak minded and weak willed. She is probably justifying it as she did with me, but that just shows ignorance and emotional immaturity.

All I have to say right now is: Fuck that bitch

observer:

Yeah that's what happened to me too. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I'm sorry she wasn't honest or did the right thing by you. She has the right to choose what she wants to do, but it's not right to drag someone into that decision without being honest with you and herself. So yeah, fuck them... sometimes the resentments serve as a reminder why you don't want to have that person in your life anymore.

It's just hard because I'm only 28 and both my parents are dead now. I feel weird because most people my age still have both parents, so I feel like I can't really relate anymore. I feel like an alien because most people my age can't really comprehend how I feel/how it feels to have no parents to turn to. And I kind of feel like I'm not... allowed to grieve or something because I didn't really get along with my dad and I didn't talk to him for months before he died. I know that even in shitty or abusive relationships or whatever, a lot of people still grieve in their own way, so I know that this is still normal I guess. I just...I dunno. I just feel so crappy. I also haven't gotten any treatment for my mental health in over a year. I did recently try to get a new therapist, but she was a bitch and I only saw her twice before walking out.

383,300,BipolarSOs,t3_oaayi2,oaayi2,"Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him? I don't know how the best way to talk to him, like approaching it for his own benefit or bringing the consideration of his loved ones in as well. Any tips and advice will help, as well as any literature or media that would help me understand the dynamics as a SO. Thanks",h3gfe9o,"Set the BD aside for a second. You’re investing yourself in a relationship with an alcoholic, which on its own is very heartbreaking and draining. Dating an addict of any kind can make your life hell.

It’s not his fault but to be trapped in the throes of addiction means you will do everything, throw away anything to support your habit.

Sucks if I go, sucks if I stay.... it's honestly breaking me. I wish I could tell you everything but I'm uncomfortable thinking that someone will identify this, even though it's so vague and a throwaway.... I'm not in any danger or in an abusive situation, it's just all really sad and I can't handle it anymore. I want to believe that everything's gonna get better but so far it's all the same. Some days are better and others I just feel like something's squeezing me inside. I'm so very tired and sad and lonely and I want to try to be ok, I want to try not to care so much about this but I fail time and time again.  Somewhere along this last year I lost sight of who I was or what I wanted and I became this shell of a person who's sad all the time over a relationship.  I don't want to lose them but sometimes it's just so unbearably painful... I'm sorry I don't even know why I'm saying all of this shit, maybe because there's no one else to listen.... I wish I was enough. Eventually things will happen one way or the other and I will be ok again in time, whatever the result, I know that deep down... I guess I just need someone else to tell me everything's gonna be ok. Sorry for the rant.",4.007329940795898

Today at our 8 week  US appointment we found out that our baby had no heartbeat and it wasn't viable. My wife is grieving but handling it well with all things considered. Me on the other hand I'm a wreck. I've been wanting a baby for a long time now and when we finally get pregnant, BOOM, it gets taken away as fast as it comes. I kept telling myself that ""What are the chances of a miscarriage happening to us."" and then when we were in that room and our doctor was taking awhile to find the embryo and couldn't find a heartbeat, I already knew what was going on.  

My wife is scheduled for a D and C next week. I know we can try again and the silver lining is that we CAN get pregnant but still the loss is hard, oh and on top of that we found out today that our dog of 12 years has kidney failure and pretty much this may be her last year so today is just one pitfall after another. We're supporting each other very well but my lovely wife has a best friend she can also vent too as a third party. For me I don't have a good friend like that so here I am reddit, looking to vent and just some support.",3.8451664447784424

He was little over a year old. I remember the day i saw him wandering around in the neighbourhood , dude was starving to death but i brought him in. Within a day or two i managed to earn his trust. I've always been so indecisive all my life but rescuing him was the best decision i've ever made . I've 3 other cats but they are more close to my other siblings , this guy was my battle buddy. I went through so much this last year but this guy was always by my side . Every time i'd come back home only to see him waiting for me on the front porch. I played video games for long hours and he'd always sleep in my lap . I've had my finals not too long ago and the only thing that helped me push through was my cat .  
On Friday , i lost a great relative and was already in so much pain when my sister called to tell me about Lee. He was meowing like crazy and he could barely walk. It took me an hour to get back home and i took him straight to the vet , the x-ray and ultra sound apparently showed nothing . He gave him some pain killers and meds for constipation. After a few hours , Lee was able to stand and walk around a bit , we thought its a good sign. Yesterday around 7pm , he started to act the same way and within an hour he became lethargic again. Then his body temps dropped massively , i tried to contact every vet there is in town but none of them responded. Around 2 am ,he died in my arms.  I haven't been able to stop crying and sleep. I don't know how i am going to survive . I can already see myself losing the battle in the near future. I cant concentrate on anything . I failed my best friend and the guilt is just killing me now . idk if i can go a day without him. Any advice on how to cope with this? please .",3.6543128490448

So far his stroke just made him a bit slower, a bit weaker in his right side and he has some problems with his speech but he can still communicate well with us.

OP it’s really easy to think like you do towards anyone who responds how your Dad has - but he isn’t just any person - he has dementia.

His brain is essentially dying and in completely unpredictable random ways. Keep that in the **forefront** of your mind before you lose it.

He could be simply afraid of falling so feels safer with his walking cane. Dementia and meds can cause dizziness so naturally they lose confidence in their sense of balance.

No matter what always remember and never forget his brain is randomly dying - there is no rhyme of reason for literally anything going forward. He will be saying and acting in ways that will be a surprise to you. He is possibly aware that something isn’t right with him and it’s like his private nightmare 

All you can do is keep him safe and validate how he feels and try to distract him towards something else should he be getting himself into spin. 

He is changing and if you can step back and observe how he changes it may make things a lot easier for you. Rather than wishing he’d just adjust or get back to who you know him to be. Instead think ‘my dads changing so let’s see how this new dad unfolds’ 

I don’t know if that’s helpful I’m just rattling on. I remember a therapist who said to me in relation to my mother who also has vascular dementia ‘any change in her behaviour is a change, she’s not being difficult she’s just becoming someone else you don’t know - yet’

I’ll update this later: hopefully with good news, but who knows.

Update: APS did not arrive yesterday. I am not sure if they will be arriving today. On some good news, the social service worker is taking my Grandmothers case seriously and has helped me to talk my Grandma into going into a Hospice facility. There are still more steps to take. But this is the furthest I have ever gotten when talking about removing her from the home. 

Thank you so much everyone for all the kind thought. It means more to me than I can express. My soul is raw. I’m so tired. The support of this community really means so much to me.",3.636906385421753

1. I saw she didnt care anymore and she became very harsh. All my nightmares brought to life. She knew my weaknesses and fears and brought them to life. Step 1 was to accept what happened no matter how much it hurt. Cry, scream, pray, all that stuff will give you some sort of piece of mind.

2. She changed her # so it made it easier but i still had her email. Block everything. If possible, do what i did and just delete your social media. I would inly recommend this if it gives you peace though. I deleted mine and have been off social media ever since for time to heal the wounds. 

3. Do not contact her.

4. Tell your friends or acquaintances that you do not want to know anything about her so to please not tell you if they see somewhere, no. Nothing. Peace of mind. We must let her fade away. 

5. Focus on yourself. Surround yourself with goals. Reach your full potential.

Ps: 3 weeks after i strted doing this, she contacted me from her new # begging me to talk to her. I never replied to one single text. Sometimes I wonder what she may have wanted.

399,359,BipolarSOs,t3_oaayi2,oaayi2,"Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him? I don't know how the best way to talk to him, like approaching it for his own benefit or bringing the consideration of his loved ones in as well. Any tips and advice will help, as well as any literature or media that would help me understand the dynamics as a SO. Thanks",h3gkemm,"BP and addiction can go hand in hand.  Your only choice is to be honest.  Tell him you are afraid for his health, you want to make this work, but you get scared and don't always know what to do when he drinks.

Before you speak with him, think about the boundaries that you want to set.  Maybe you don't want him drinking around you, or there perhaps there are other things you need from him.  Have a sense of what those things are, and relay your boundaries.

Lastly, know that his response to this convo is not about you, it is about him.  If he responds with yelling and screaming, not your fault, his ego isn't ready to hear it.  If he is understanding and wants to do the work, it wasn't magic delivery, it was him being ready to hear what you have to say, and put his ego aside to build a relationship.

He is very lucky to have someone that cares, but you owe him nothing.

Hi all,

I have been long distance dating this guy for a while now and he has bipolar. He was doing well for a while, but since going back to his parents house to care for grandparents and not having enough money to continue with therapy, it has all been triggering him to drink too much and too often. As I said, we are long distance but I have been staying with him over the summer so I have been seeing his moods and behaviors first hand. There have been some episodes where I felt in over my head to handle properly. I am unsure of what to do in those instances, and when my bf and I talk about it he is very apologetic and swears that he is gonna get better because he doesn't want to lose me. But then the next night he'll drink 6+ beers and pass out or take shots knowing he is out of his mood stabilizer. I don't want to overreact by admitting him to a hospital but I also don't want something to happen because I wasn't equipped to handle the situation. 

The advice that I'm seeking is how to talk to him about the importance of taking his meds and how it affects the people around him? I don't know how the best way to talk to him, like approaching it for his own benefit or bringing the consideration of his loved ones in as well. Any tips and advice will help, as well as any literature or media that would help me understand the dynamics as a SO. Thanks

And I feel kind of responsible. He had a history of getting bad UTIs when he was super stressed. We just had a lot of life changes. We moved, got a new roommate who had a dog(the two animals got along though), and then I broke my ankle and had to stay with family a short trip away because I needed help.

My father has been a very negative thinker all his life. Ever since I was little, I can remember him being completely healthy and still thinking he wouldn’t be alive in 5 years. I remember us planning a holiday for the next year and he already thought back then he would be dead, even if he was as healthy as one could be. So I am quite used to him being negative and giving counter replies. 

But ever since he has gotten the news of cancer and now cancer spreading, Im having a difficult time with how to deal with it. He’s very negative still, saying things like he wont be here long anymore (even though the doctors are saying that they can still try doing stuff, but it is uncureable). Every conversation I have with him ends up with him saying he’ll be gone soon. Everything gets turned and twisted into the awful topic. 

And the thing is, I reaaaaaally get it. I really understand him. It is so awful so I dont want him to close in on us and not communicate about how bad he is feeling at all. Because were all very open communicators. But i’m also noticing how bad this negative mentality is on his health. Ever since he’s gotten the news three weeks ago, he’s lost so much weight while he hasnt even had treatment yet for example. I feel like his mindset is contributing to him becoming more ill. And its so important for him to keep eating good by himself. 

He also has the tendency to give these very grim replies to other people as well. Then he gets upset when people seem to avoid him since he got sick. It’s just the most heartbreaking thing ever to hear your parent say that.

It's an uncomfortable and tender feeling being the daughter of a woman who has Alzheimer's. 

She is blissfully and sometimes unblissfully living in a different time and age. A time I didnt exist maybe, or maybe her young mother days. It could be four years back, I'll never know.

She herself is child like now, has developed a sweet tooth and the telltale bluntness that I've heard accompanies Alzheimer's, hurts you when you least expect it. I remind myself that's not Cathy, that Al. Fuck you, Al.

Today my mum asked me who I was very casually in the back isle of the discount store. She scoffed at my answer as if i was lying yet eagerly followed me. And i didn't know what to say to her. So I told her I was her friend. Which is true. But quietly, the Bargin-mania had become the backdrop to my sorrow.

I feel guilty and werid mourning my mums personality and her ways, while she is still here physically and giving that winning Cathy Barry smile. She truley is crucial to the whole damn operation. Responsible for so many planted seeds in my life.

I just fucking miss her. HER her. And I wish she understood that.

I don't share about this often,  but today, instead if going inwards and into the darkness, this short essay of my feelings seems correct.",3.8326737880706787

I lost my mum over 13 years ago and still  think of her nearly everyday. And, particularly at those moments I would have loved to be able to share with her.

My mom died last night. I'm 17 years old. She would turn 57 in 5 days.
She died peacefully and happy. My father was with her.

She had cancer for about 2 or 3 years. We already knew she wouldn't survive.
The last few weeks were bad. It was going downhill really fast, but we didn't think she would die already.

The weird part is, I feel fine. I'm sad, but not as sad as Yesterday. When she was alive.
She kept saying that she wanted to go, meet jesus, hug him.
Hearing that really broke me. I wasn't ready for her to die, I'm still not ready.

Her last words to me, my father and my brother were ""I love you"" and ""you'll be fine"". And we will, but we need to process everything first

me and my father take care of my alzheimer mother.
she was getting home visits from doctors but i think my father told them to stop coming.
we dont take her to a hosbital for i think a year, only my father go and take her high blood pressure medicine. 

about a month ago, we took her to a hosbital because she didnt pee for 24 hours. they solved the problem and they said her blood pressure was good. that was around 12 am. i give her blood pressure medicine around 1 pm. 

3 days later around 2 pm, we went to a different hosbital to get her urinary catheterization out, they said also that her blood pressure is alittle bit high and she need to take her medicine twice a day.

i thought that was because she was nervous and she just had her medicine so i didnt follow what they told me.

she seemed fine to me. and i used to give her medicine crushed in full cup of water so i thought that made it less effective, so i started giving her medicine in 1/4 cup of water.

I got pregnant in February with my first but it ended in March. The baby stopped growing around 5 and a half weeks. I was so beyond excited for that baby. I didn’t think I’d lose it. I never thought that would be me. 

It hurt but I picked myself back up and tried again. I got pregnant again in May. My hcg level were checked this time. They weren’t last time. They seemed lower than most people’s but were still doubling so I just told myself a second miscarriage in a row is unlikely and to not worry. Then symptoms disappeared. Over the weekend I started cramping pretty badly. I felt so bad I could barely get out of bad. Then early this morning I started lightly spotting. It stopped for now. I’m going to contact my doctor today. But I’m upset and angry. I can’t even enjoy being pregnant this time because of my previous miscarriage. I’m constantly worrying. 

I know there’s a chance the baby be okay but it wasn’t last time. Even when I was full on bleeding I still had hope. I’m scared to get my hopes up. 

I thought getting pregnant would be one of the best experiences of my life. I was wrong. All of this is so stressful. I hate every second of it.

If we lose this one, we’ll keep trying. I know once I hold my baby in arms everything will be worth it. There’s a baby meant for my family and that it’ll come when it’s meant to. So I’m trying to be patient. I’m trying so hard.

I got pregnant in February with my first but it ended in March. The baby stopped growing around 5 and a half weeks. I was so beyond excited for that baby. I didn’t think I’d lose it. I never thought that would be me. 

It hurt but I picked myself back up and tried again. I got pregnant again in May. My hcg level were checked this time. They weren’t last time. They seemed lower than most people’s but were still doubling so I just told myself a second miscarriage in a row is unlikely and to not worry. Then symptoms disappeared. Over the weekend I started cramping pretty badly. I felt so bad I could barely get out of bad. Then early this morning I started lightly spotting. It stopped for now. I’m going to contact my doctor today. But I’m upset and angry. I can’t even enjoy being pregnant this time because of my previous miscarriage. I’m constantly worrying. 

I know there’s a chance the baby be okay but it wasn’t last time. Even when I was full on bleeding I still had hope. I’m scared to get my hopes up. 

I thought getting pregnant would be one of the best experiences of my life. I was wrong. All of this is so stressful. I hate every second of it.

If we lose this one, we’ll keep trying. I know once I hold my baby in arms everything will be worth it. There’s a baby meant for my family and that it’ll come when it’s meant to. So I’m trying to be patient. I’m trying so hard.

We've known each other for 10 years, and in the last 3 of those, we were together, and I never thought she would put an end to it.

I miss her every day, that's true, but I also feel like I'm making progress every day. It's been hard, and slow though. I no longer talk to her, nor tell her how I feel when she asked (that usually ended up in both of us crying), and I no longer stalk her social media nor her new ""boyfriend""  (they are not dating yet, but he's the reason she broke up with me, so I guess it's a matter of time). I'm healing, slowly, and somedays it doesn't feel that way, but I know I am.

She was my first love, and I was hers, and neither time nor her new boyfriend will change that. I'm letting her go, althought it pains me to even write that.

And you can do that too. I know life seems hard now, but time heals everything.

I had a lot of friends and support throughout that time, I found myself again, am in a good university with great people and was really really happy again. But I always thought of you up there.

My dad got a new girlfriend 2 years ago or so, I really like her and her 10 year old kid, having a full house again besides myself and my dad was nice.

Today I’m working at a summer camp I went to when I was younger, really nice people and was really looking forward to making this a really good summer.

Around 2 months ago my dad and his girlfriend said they were having another baby. I was going to be a big brother, and even at 20 years old I was so ecstatic and happy to have a sibling for the first time.

My IRL mom passed away 4 years ago when I was 16, and that was hard. I had a lot of friends and support throughout that time, I found myself again, am in a good university with great people and was really really happy again. But I always thought of you up there.

My dad got a new girlfriend 2 years ago or so, I really like her and her 10 year old kid, having a full house again besides myself and my dad was nice.

Today I’m working at a summer camp I went to when I was younger, really nice people and was really looking forward to making this a really good summer.

Around 2 months ago my dad and his girlfriend said they were having another baby. I was going to be a big brother, and even at 20 years old I was so ecstatic and happy to have a sibling for the first time.

Also, the famous cliche ""You can't love someone until you love yourself"". They have to work on themselves. This is a very unhealthy relationship. Codependent and hurting your ability to grow and fulfill your own dreams. We only have so much time. I know this sucks. I got dumped recently after being together for three years.

In some ways we are so perfect for eachother, same sense of humour, slow dancing to old songs, little things that show caring. And I love him too, I really do. I care for him deeply and would never want to hurt him, but I can’t stay if I’m not happy. It isn’t even something he did wrong, necessarily. He’s kind of just someone who talks about doing x y z and only half-ass does z and doesn’t even do the rest at all. We’ve talked about joint bank accounts, fixing things in the house, etc and it never happens. He has switched jobs about 20 times in the last few years. He doesn’t take care of himself physically despite a health issue. Any time we try to do something together, whether it’s grocery shopping or moving furniture or driving somewhere it ends up some dumb argument. I stopped voicing my opinion just to avoid arguments. There have been a few times where I needed him (one was a funeral) and he didn’t come to be with me, and it hurt because I was there every time his family member passed. It just isn’t a situation I want to marry into. And on my end, I haven’t fully committed to us either. I went behind his back with some things (no cheating but lots of lies) and I don’t feel I’m a good partner to him.  How am I supposed to hurt this man who loves me so much. I know he might even consider suicide, he’s said he would before when we’ve had bad fights. I don’t want that, it would be devastating. But I can’t stay just to keep him happy. I am crying all day and night not knowing how to do this to him. How do I hurt this man who I love, and then leave him with that pain, knowing I can’t help him get through it like I’ve done so many times with other problems. How do I live with the guilt of ruining someone’s life when they didn’t really do me wrong. I’m so lost.",3.9059176445007324
