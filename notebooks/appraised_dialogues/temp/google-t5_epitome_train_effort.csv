Wearing a mask is exhausting as hell, and the longer you try to keep it up, the more explosive will it be, when you can't hold it up any longer. In that regard, I speak from experience. And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you. Noone feels 100% happy all the time, and if so, I'd call them liars. If you want, shoot me a pm, anytime!

Do you have someone you can talk to? For example have a really deep conversation, tell them about your biggest fears? Where you dont have to pretend to be happy?

And last but not least, it's completely fine to not feel happy sometimes. You just have to feel sad, out of the loop, neglected, rejected or even hated sometimes. Those are the moments where you really analyze yourself and your doings, (something you should keep under control, because too much of it is destructive), and if you embrace it, roll with it, telling yourself that this is natural and just a response of something inside you, you can't really pinpoint yet, those times could actually end up being beneficial for you.

It definitely doesn't sound like you're very stable right now, and I can relate to feeling like you can't think straight and need to find something drastic to snap out of it.

22,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.0,1.0,Wish I was never born. Not looking for attention or advice to look on the bright side just hoping to get some perspective on how I feel. And maybe what it means psychologically to feel this way. All of my life I've felt like the black sheep. I never fit in anywhere really. I wish I was never born. I feel like I haven't impacted anyone's life and if I did it was negative or non existent. I should feel like I have a purpose. I have been married 6 years two kids later but even then if I died tomo who would care? How would the world be different. I just spoke to my husband about(hoping to maybe get some comfort in knowing I impacted his life for the better?) this was his exact words were yeah well I see how you could think that that was it. It broke me and felt like it validated my point. This life feels life a prison. It feels worthless and sickening to know no matter where I go it does t really even matter. How many others feel this way????,3.6570358276367188,45.0,0.0,"Yeah, I resonate with a lot of what you're saying.

Tell me everything you have tried.",3.3968420028686523
